 Joe Wright's Darkest Hour stylishly follows Winston Churchill's early days as Prime Minister with a transformative performance from Gary Oldman.| It's somewhat interesting to witness the events that led to one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century, but not 2 hours, 5-minutes worth of interesting.| Except for the make-up job on Oldman, not much to write home about--least of all the idea that Churchill was defending "Western Civilization" against the brutes. Tell that to the Indians and Kenyans.| A superb portrayal of Winston Churchill.| ... manages to capture Churchill's high-profile charisma as well as his eccentricities during the film's quieter and more contemplative moments.| Oldman's turn here at times feels like a great performance, and at others, like a parody of a great performance.| A career-capping personal best for Oscar contender Gary Oldman. Kristin Scott-Thomas and Lily James also shine.| Oldman commands every inch of the frame, and director Joe Wright often finds him in dark spaces, with a shaft of sunlight miraculously touching only him.| Everything about the film is exemplary and would fit well on a double bill of history with Dunkirk.| Gary Oldman's transformative portrayal of Winston Churchill in Joe Wright's Darkest Hour achieves the same rarefied orbit as Marlon Brando's interpretation of the Godfather. If this be critical blasphemy, so be it.| Darkest Hour rises above the trappings of its genre thanks to a stirring performance by Gary Oldman.| Wright tones down his usual visual flourishes, but his dramatic command is the strongest it's been in years.| While Dunkirk is all visceral action and Their Finest gentle satire, however, Darkest Hour is mostly talk, focusing on political negotiations between the faction who wanted to sue for peace and those who wanted to fight...| "Darkest Hour" is a one man show for Oldman. And what a show it is.| Oldman disappears into the role...and Kristin Scott Thomas is impeccable in showing us Clementine's elegance and resolve.| Makes you wish we had someone like Churchill to help fight the Nazis this time.| Oldman brings a wicked wit and compassionate heart to the role, one for which he seems almost superhumanly suited for - and that's really saying something, consider how many great actors have played Churchill.| It's less effective in crafting a portrait of this man outside of the political and military realm.| Darkest Hour invites viewers inside the heart and mind of a great leader but never really captures his deep rapport with the British people, which turned out to be one of his greatest political assets. Dunkirk takes a more populist approach.| From an historical point of view, there are aspects of Wright's film one might debate, but, capped by Oldman's strong performance, it's one of the better recent films about the great British statesman.|
