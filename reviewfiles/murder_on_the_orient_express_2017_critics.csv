 The immortal story of Christie has been recycled into a luxurious first rate popcorn adventure... [Full review in Spanish]| The new movie has been handsomely shot and produced, but the raw punch produced by Christie in her extended climax is missing.| Branagh embraces a corny, old-fashioned tone that should make it stand out at the modern cineplex, but he's disappointingly inconsistent in rendering the movie lively.| The tension of the Christie novel ... never really emerges in a film that seems dazzled by the refined costumes, the train's luxury trappings and far too much CGI.| What's next? Bringing back Charlie Chan? MURDER lacks ugliness, spite and callousness. Branagh talks too much. | Not only has Kenneth Branagh retained the exotic romanticism of Christie's novels, he has found dimensions to the Dame's stories that I - despite being a tremendous fan of her books - had never expected, and honestly, never even thought of.| The kind of old-fashioned mystery you take your mom to see that one time of the year she asks you to take her to the movies. [Full review in Spanish]| Passionate, agile and very entertaining. [Full Review in Spanish] | [Kenneth Branagh] makes a simple mistake; he leaves his mark all over the crime scene. [Full Review in Spanish]| There's little attempt to update, darken or otherwise mess with the original formula, and Branagh leans into the story's ITV Christmas Special trappings with aplomb.| A detective story that questions easy distinctions between right and wrong.| Branagh's retelling of the classic Agatha Christie tale is visually sumptuous yet otherwise inert, a series of what are essentially cameos by performers far too gifted to waste their time like this.| ... I do not consider it a bad production, although it fails in its main objective. [Full review in Spanish]| ... "Murder on the Orient Express" doesn't come together well enough to recommend viewing. [Full review in Spanish]| Branagh lards Haris Zambarloukos' cinematography with gratuitous CGI until it looks like Murder on the Polar Express.| It is heartening to find Branagh afforded the means to realize a personal, idiosyncratic interpretation of this material, dazzling in scope but the product of care.| At least Branagh's Hercule Poirot is fun and multi-layered, but the rest of the cast are hung out to dry, hammily looking off into the middle distance to imply that they might have done it ... Dull as dishwater.| When describing Kenneth Branagh's take on Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express, [old fashioned] should definitely be taken as a compliment.| They don't make 'em like Murder on the Orient Express any more, but when they do, by chance, make 'em, they should cut 'em into tiny pieces, place 'em in a hole, and set 'em on fire, possibly with a sign warning everyone not to sift through the ashes.| This is a very solid adaptation of the oft-filmed classic. This new version features a more humane, vulnerable, introspective version of the famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, played by Kenneth Branagh ('Dunkirk') who also directs the film. |
