 All in all, this cast does make a team, but I think Pfeiffer steals her scenes with an enigmatic look.| It is a nice autumn surprise to watch an old-school whodunit amidst superhero extravaganzas, but it often falls victim to its own excess.| The necessity of such a re-adaptation is directly proportional to the comparative talent involved. In this case, it's a significant step down from the first.| Murder on the Orient Express runs its course from beginning to end, neither picking up steam nor derailing into subzero hell| It is a pity that, though this film has good elements that could have been better exploited, in the end, it turns out to be a film that serves as a showcase for its protagonist -and director. [Full Review in Spanish] | Branagh commandeers the movie, turning it into a showcase for himself as Poirot. Everyone else is left to circle the drain.| There's something quaint and comforting about this film and its brand of old-fashioned storytelling, where coincidences are extremely likely, everyone somehow knows a countess, and a man puts honor above all else. | I left the theater with two items on my "To Do" list. First, book a trip for myself on the real Orient Express. Second, rewatch the 1974 movie. | It stops dead in its tracks shortly after leaving the station and leaves the audience numb and bored to death.| Branagh wastes the riches that surround him on every score and turns the performances of his cast mates into something of a museum tour - cursory glances at masterpieces hung beautifully, but in isolation.| There are attempts at 1930s upper-class lushness - lots of art deco touches on the train, period-accurate fashion and shots of European scenery in winter - but it is garnishing on a mediocre dish.| While Murder On The Orient Express does have its heart in the right place, it doesn't quite get the game of sleuth as good as it should.| The puzzle-box mechanics of the Christie murder mystery - a fixed number of persons, all limited in movement and clues which, at the climax, lock into place - are kept as immaculate as the table settings in the dining car.| It might not be as magical or as intriguing as the 1974 version - until now that is still the best adaptation of the story - but there is still enough here to keep the story from completely going off the rails.| The immortal story of Christie has been recycled into a luxurious first rate popcorn adventure... [Full review in Spanish]| The new movie has been handsomely shot and produced, but the raw punch produced by Christie in her extended climax is missing.| Branagh embraces a corny, old-fashioned tone that should make it stand out at the modern cineplex, but he's disappointingly inconsistent in rendering the movie lively.| The tension of the Christie novel ... never really emerges in a film that seems dazzled by the refined costumes, the train's luxury trappings and far too much CGI.| What's next? Bringing back Charlie Chan? MURDER lacks ugliness, spite and callousness. Branagh talks too much. | Not only has Kenneth Branagh retained the exotic romanticism of Christie's novels, he has found dimensions to the Dame's stories that I - despite being a tremendous fan of her books - had never expected, and honestly, never even thought of.|
