 Sensuous and sumptuous, this poignant, fantastical fable is an enchanting, redemptive, interspecies love story.| Eggs, water, and-yes-sex all play crucial and overlapping roles in director Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, an adult fairy tale that is at once deeply familiar and utterly original.| Del Toro has given us a small piece of cinematic magic with The Shape of Water. | Further makes the case that no one does fantasy on del Toro's level.| It's a moving and charming film that doesn't shy away from the ugliness of life, choosing instead to celebrate beauty wherever it may be found.| "A gorgeously rendered story of love, passion, and beauty"| Del Toro exceeds self with this modern fairy-tale/Gothic romance. Hawkins is stunning. The La-La Land of monster movies.| The cast is wonderful-Jenkins is warm and lovable, Spencer is funny, and Shannon, as always, plays the perfect snake. But it's Hawkins' silent performance that's the knockout here.| ... this is one of those adventurous pieces of cinematic imagination I find I like more and more as time goes by.| ... the film is simply stunning to behold.| Guillermo del Toro returns to fine form with this fairy tale-cum-horror story that effectively echoes the texture, mood and style of his 2006 gem, "Pan's Labyrinth."| Enchanting and annoying in equal measures.| It's a testament to the storyteller's skill that he manages to cram [so much] into his narrative with nary a lump and still keep his characters dancing with only one or two minor missteps. | Perhaps never quite as poetic as its wonderful title, The Shape of Water nonetheless allows del Toro to give full vent to an imagination into which movies flow, cinematic tributaries that fuel his sense of invention.| Perhaps [Del Toro's] loveliest film so far, easily on par with his masterpiece "Pan's Labyrinth."| Few films leave me awestruck for weeks. But the way Guillermo del Toro juggles heart, imagination, suspense, social history, outsider attitude and weird artistry so successfully in this Cold War monster romance continues to astound me.| It's gorgeous and weird, heart-wrenching and utterly unforgettable. | The Shape of Water opens and closes on a sub-aqueous scene, but everything else about it is buoyant and uplifting.| Beautifully shot, designed, and acted but dramatically inert.| To see The Shape of Water is to be catapulted into a dream world of dancing raindrops and swirling colours that toggle between scary and cool. Smart money says you'll enjoy the sensation either way.|
