  Excelent cartoon! Very easy explanation of the Story of Baby Jesus!Good Job Guys! looking forward for an easter movie made easy for kids!|  Adorable film with heart, humor and hope.|  This movie is awesome for those that love the god and understand the trials and tribulations that come when life is truly beating you down. It's cute for children and families to see as a whole. But for parents to read between the lines and be able to give your child more guidance about life and all the adversity they will face. I don't care what the naysayers have to say I loved this movie!!!|  My grand daughter loved this movie as did the rest of the family|  Though not as bad as Sony Animation's other film this year, The Star will not go down as a classic with Elf and Nightmare Before Christmas.|  Can't shake the feeling that this exists only to indoctrinate the young.|  I saw it twice with grandchildren and we loved it! Star is a fun movie about the birth of Jesus!|  Nice Holiday movie to take the kids to!|  Took our 9 and 5 yr. grandsons and they loved it. So did I. All the bad reviews are by people who don't believe in the Bible or the story of Jesus birth. Yeah, it may be a little corny at times, but it's a good movie and a wonderful way to share the story of Jesus' birth with your kids or grand kids.|  good film the donkey is very funny|  This is typically a pitch movie. The pitch was probably great but the delivery is very mediocre. Technically there is nothing to say about the movie but there is also no enjoyment to watch it. It's flat. Worse, I am not even sure what public is the target of this movie. It's a miss.|  This is a wonderful "real Christmas movie." Our family loves Santa movies too, but this beautifully done account of the nativity story was a refreshing change. It captures all the energy of a children's movie while telling this special Bible story. All three of my children (ages 8, 7 and 3) loved it. Planning to make it an annual family movie!|  Unless you enjoy criticizing every aspect of every movie you watch then this is certainly a must see. My kids loved it and so did the other adults with us. I'm not sure why every critic feels every movie must move you like a concert piece by Mozart. It's baffling. If you want your kids to get a basic gist of Christ's birth along with some pretty funny moments then this movie is worth the price of admission. If you don't see it in theaters you certainly can't go wrong buying it on DVD Blu-ray or 4K. This will become a holiday tradition for my family!|  a great movie telling the Christmas story. Good humor and heart warming.|  Though animation quality, etc is clearly "B" level - it stays fairly close to the Biblical account and is quite fun.|  Lovely movie, nice message|  Adorable rendition of the greatest story of all time! C|  Very good family movie. good for kids and adults. lots of funny parts too.|  It was good, a different telling of the story, but good.|  Forget the critics - who apparently don't much care for an animated version of a Bible story. This story stays remarkably close to the scriptures - yes, there are jokes and fun but the story is largely correct without being "preachy." It's a safe movie to take kids (of all ages) and, despite the "haters" in the critics world, it's quite well done.|
