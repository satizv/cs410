  Definitely relying on Denzel Washingtons intriguing performance, the movie still offers a solid drama and some interesting stuff to keep you invested. A bit too drawn out and a somewhat strange conclusion but still a enjoyable, well acted picture.|  To follow up one of 2014's best films, Nightcrawler, is no enviable task, but director Dan Gilroy had to do it eventually. While Roman J. Israel, Esq. lacks the palpable tension and atmosphere of its predecessor, it still stands sturdily on a dynamic lead performance. Denzel Washington is no stranger to playing complicated characters, and Roman is a role that he really stretches out and fits right into. Roman is an Aspergers afflicted attorney who has been fighting for civil rights from case to case for decades. Having always remained in the shadows as the man behind a more charismatic lawyer, his partner's sudden heart attack brings Roman out of his comfort zone for fear of losing his livelihood. The obvious parallel to Nightcrawler is that both films are about characters whose obsessive natures bring out the worst in them, but unlike Lou Bloom, despite Roman's temptations and faults, he's not a sociopath. He's a principled man who is forced to come to terms with how society has changed the standards by which his principles are valued. In that aspect it is a compelling film, unfortunately the ending brings this character study to an (arguably) fruitless conclusion. I suppose one could cobble together a symbolic meaning of how society's responsibility to righting injustice has shifted in demographics and ideology, but the film and Washington's performance seem like a lot of work for such an understated purpose. Ultimately, it's a well made but unsatisfying watch.|  Too convoluted, too preachy and not enough empathy for the titled character makes Washington and Farrell performances the only saving grace. (12-6-17)|  A could of have been much more but I was so taken by Washington's offbeat performance I was invested enough. However, the message or Moral that the director Gilroy tried to convey was so muddled I still don't know what it was. Colin Farrell is also very good as a high powered west coast attorney. Great sound track! 12-06-2017|  At my 50th law school reunion, I said the law had turned into a business and was criticized by a tort lawyer who advertises in the entire inside front and back covers of the Yellow Pages. R I Israel, Esq. is one hell of a film. On the one hand, it's a film about lawyers like Roman J Israel who are obsessed with fairness, justice and truth in a failed system too focused on how many cases can be settled or plead out daily. On the other hand, just about every one else in RJ Israel's profession is centered around taking money for hopeless cases. After 23 years, when Atty Israel hits the bricks without a job, he meets reality and he breaks every rule with the inevitable result. It's a great movie about a profession that should engineer justice and social change but is unfortunately is caught up on the bottom line. Money trumps justice.|  I came into this movie with an open mind. The message of this movie is so beautiful and well done. Denzel played his character so well and the emotions he portrayed were excellent. Please, please, please pay attention to the movies messages. You have to really pay attention to the overall message and what the premise of the story is. Go into the movie with an open mind and you come out amazed at what Denzel can do with a character.|  This is the longest, most boring movie I've ever seen. I kept waiting for it to get better...it never did. Truly awful, wish I could give it negative stars.|  It is different. More like an independent art film. It is not your typical cookie-cutter Hollywood film.|  this was a very good movie|  This movie was absolutely GREAT ???? and a Must See this movie is definitely about the aspect of human dignity, human error and the responsibility of mankind. I have seen Roman J Isreal three times and each time I have been moved to have discourse with the young and aged! Soundtrack was great ???? ????????????|  Solid film that combines some courtroom drama with a dash of suspense and a little romance filled in between. Denzel Washington gives another great performance that keeps the audience interested in this washed up character.|  Denzel turns in a decent performance in an otherwise totally forgettable film.|  I actually enjoyed this film very much. I can relate to the personal struggles of this character. It's a reminder to stay vigilant and how easy it is to get caught up in the modern world and get complacent.|  Close to going 3.5* bc Denzel.....|  This movie is neither dramatic nor a thriller. It over-promises and under-delivers - a bad combination. And not even Denzel Washington's brilliance can save it. The movie confuses its timeline - making the main character seem as if he's from the 70s/80s and throws in some references to make it seem like 90s or early 2000s but then is present day. The main character seems to be an idiot savant afraid of new technology and yet uses technology. For what should've been a simple story line, the writers blew it significantly. The timeline is out of whack for the dramatic reveal and they mistake a "what could have happened" scenario for what did happen. The timeline is supposedly three weeks - which feels like its playing out in real time - and time references in the movie allude to this. As this movie demonstrates, heroes sadly sometimes fall and in this one Denzel Washington and Colin Farrell did here. I'm confident they will pick themselves back up and be back to delivering on the promised goods soon.|  Thought it was slow and failed to tell a good story well, although Denzel was fabulous and carried the others. Colin Farrell was never a good actor.|  I am going to keep things simple in this one, unlike this film. Denzel Washington delivers a captivating performance in the title role that does not get supported by the film he stars in. This film tries to be in multiple different genres of film yet never seems to go into any of them. The story is surprisingly unfocused and jumps around to different story arcs at times and then at other times takes to long. Its a shame, because this could have been a remarkable movie.|  Wonderful dialogue and I was moved by the transformation and growth of all the major characters. A true work of art!|  Denzel Washington is really good; story somewhat tedious. Could have easily shortened it by 30 min without losing any of the drama.|  Look like Dan Gilroy had a lot to say|
