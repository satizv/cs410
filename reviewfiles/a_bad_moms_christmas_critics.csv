 At the end of the day, A Bad Moms Christmas isn't a pretentious film and it gives us what it promises... [Full review in Spanish]| Highly predictable, and yet is able to act as a good sequel to a successful comedy thanks to the charisma of the actresses. [Full Review in Spanish] | Words are not easy to come by when it comes to describing the experience of sitting through and watching A Bad Mom's Christmas. Adjectives such as agonising, laborious and torturous definitely spring to mind...| A Bad Moms Christmas, much like its predecessor, has an admirable idea of paying tribute to all these unsung female heroines; it's too bad the filmmakers are only concerned with vagina and d*** jokes| ...no matter how much they mess up, everything will return to normal when the third act ends. [Full review in Spanish]| Just as funny and, even though I never thought it possible, raunchier then "Bad Moms..." | The whole thing is entertaining enough, just, but you have to wonder why Lucas and Moore made a film. What they essentially give us is a series of unrelated "overbearing mother" comedy sketches which would be better suited to a festive TV special.| [The stars], having soiled themselves with last year's loathsome Bad Moms, wade into more of the same, this time dragging Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines and Susan Sarandon ... down into the muck with them. | Wilder but not better, A Bad Moms Christmas is a mediocre bridge between the original film and the inevitable Bad Grandmas.| Takes the easiest route - upping the raucousness, adding even more mums to the mix, and eschewing nuance, depth or any real comic commentary about the expectations placed upon women.| A Bad Moms Christmas is not an absolutely terrible movie, but it's just very uninspired.| This present is akin to a lump of coal in all our stockings.| The film's raucous humour is just rude enough to seem transgressive, even if it isn't.| Calling it a broad comedy would be like fat-shaming an entire genre.| Clearly aiming to cash in on the (undeserved) success of last year's Bad Moms, this slapdash sequel is even more dispiriting.| It'll entertain you while on the verge of a turkey coma, but it will never rank among the Christmas classics.| For a movie that pretends to be against excess-three exasperated moms are going to "take Christmas back", dammit-this sequel really doesn't know when to stop.| The plot is slapped together, with an excess of music montages used to pad everything out. Seriously, A Bad Moms Christmas has enough music montages to make Rocky IV jealous. | The less said about the performances, the better. The three main leads seem to be going through the motions with barely any investment into their characters. | It's really not 'Bad' - just average.|
