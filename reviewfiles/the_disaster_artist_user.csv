  Rather interesting movie, didn't know it was a true story. They wrote the movie exactly the way the story of the real characters. Worth watching better than i thought.|  funny drama with a brilliant performance by james franco|  What a fun film. I've never been a big James Franco fan, but I thought he was perfect. Lots of humor, not much filler. You really need to see The Room to fully appreciate this move.|  The Disaster Artist is enjoyable whether or not you've seen the source material. The movie paints Tommy in a much more sympathetic light than the trailer might let on. It's a great movie about the making of a bad movie that will make you laugh, cringe and maybe cry. Maybe.|  The best filmmakers are the ones who put their heart and soul into something they had a specific vision for and see it out until its release. Albeit a strange and unclear vision, Tommy Wiseau certainly envisioned something for The Room. Whether or not he knew all along that it would be interpreted at a comedy (there's no way), who knows. But there will always be room for people in Hollywood who put everything into making a film. The Disaster Artist does its best to exemplify the balance between a chaotic mess of making a movie to the heart and devotion of someone trying to make their dreams come true.The Disaster Artist takes a mostly comedic approach to the source material, but it does have plenty of heartfelt moments, thanks to the chemistry of the Franco brothers as Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sistero, two men devoted to making their own Hollywood movie since the city continues to "disrespect" and "misunderstand" their talents. I'm always on board to watch a movie where people pursue their dreams, especially those trying to make it in Hollywood. Throw in the fact that Wiseau remains a mystery in real life, as does the production behind The Room, and you have yourself a movie worth making.Something The Room clearly didn't do is establish a specific tone to ensure everything runs cohesively throughout the movie. Where scenes constantly come and go with no real reason or explanation in The Room, The Disaster Artist makes good use of its runtime to make a quick and memorable bio-drama that is equally as entertaining as it is endearing. I initially walked away from watching The Room with confusion and misplaced laughter, I came out of The Disaster Artist even more fascinated with Wiseau's history and the troubled production of The Room.So although Wiseau never could have imagined there would be a movie made about his trainwreck of a film, I can't help but feel happy that Wiseau eventually got to this position, and in a way, fulfilled his dreams. 9.0/10|  Really fun movie....it drew me in and ended up loving it!!! James and Dave Franco do a great job!!!|  I wouldn't miss a movie that has James Franco and Seth Rogen.|  A hilarious, satirical and surprisingly poignant take on the making of one of the most notoriously bad movies of all-time. Franco as director and actor hits new creative success. He draws strong performances from his talented cast, especially from his brother Dave, who does some of his best work. But it's Franco's own performance as the infamous Wiseau that truly impresses. He goes beyond an impression to portray not only Wiseau's naivete but his passion and vulnerability. Franco is also hysterical in nailing all of Wiseau's odd quirks. This is one of the funniest movies of the year and also one of the strangest about the creative process.|  The Disaster Artist explores the enigma that is Tommy Wiseau with equal parts humor, irony, and genuine affection.|  This is an engaging & fun movie about the making of a Midnight Showing Cult Classic & the friendship that developed between the two stars in the process. I really liked this movie and the Franco brothers both gave great performances in this. Definitely a better movie than "The Room" itself.|  Loved the film! I hope The Disaster Artist receives an Academy Awards nomination.|  Not as good as some critics are saying. The characters have no motivation for being friends and it feels more like fan service for fans of the Room than an actual biopic of Tommy Wiseau. Some jokes fall flat on their faces but I can give recognition to the brilliant performances and the accuracy towards what actually happened on the set of one of the best worst movies of all time.|  Spectacularly funny! James Franco gives an exceptional performance as Tommy Wiseau, the creator of The Room in one of 2017s best film offerings. The Disaster Artist surpassed my expectations and makes a worthy contender for this year?s awards season contenders. Highly recommended!|  This film is as funny as it is emotional. The main celebrity leads are amazing at not only portraying real life people, but being really funny at the same time. Dave as Greg is as much a compelling lead as the hilarious James Franco as Tommy Wiseau. If you like comedies you will love this movie. If you like film production you will love this movie. If you like The Room (like i do) you will LOVE this film. The only real criticism are the abundance of celebrity cameos but that's a nitpick. This film is the "Ed Wood" of the 2010s and is actually quite the heart tugger with it's message of following your dreams. A definite yes from me.|  Entertaining and funny and does do some justice for The Room.|  Absolutely hilarious film that hit all the right emotions. I loved the graininess of the film bringing you to that late 90s look which captures the essence of setting of this comedy. Franco brothers did it again, fantastic job.|  This was a great film and an amazing performance from Franco!|  Out of the the three - the original film, the book, and the book adaptation - this is my least favorite. Although it did faithfully delivered on the laughs, drama, and tension of the book, I never could quite shake the feeling that I was watching Franco do a parody of Tommy...it never immersed me the way the book did. Maybe it's my fault for "knowing" Tommy too well to be able to accept a simulacrum. I was surprised to find many people in the audience (who were eagerly talking during the credits with me about the football, Tommy W. underwear, and The Room script I had brought along...) who enjoyed the movie without ever having seen the original film.|  I really enjoyed this movie. It's a mix of both comedy and drama. It tells the story behind the making of a good terrible movie, but more importantly, it portrays a heartwarming tale of friendship.|
