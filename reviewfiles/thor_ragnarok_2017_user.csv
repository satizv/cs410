  BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER( still waiting for inf war)|  From dramedy to comedy Thor Ragnarok was a winner! It's a fun movie with a lot of easter eggs that will lead us into the next movies.|  Definitely one of the best super hero films of this year, Thor: Ragnarok does just about everything right. Taking the mythos and magic from the original Thor movie and doing away with the bland, dreary, boring colors of Thor 2, Thor: Ragnarok brings in colors and tones to a mythos that fits in perfectly with it. This film does a better job at making the Marvel Cinematic Universe feel like a universe than any Marvel film before it. Decent villain, at least in Marvel standards at the moment, great cast, hilarious moments, fun action, and an amazing soundtrack make this one of the best Marvel films to date.|  Thor Ragnarok stands out against its competition in the superhero movie world, however it still feels like a lot of the Marvel movies you have seen before. A good time at the theater but forgettable soon after.|  A fun and engaging film, and is a breath of fresh air from all of the safe and predictable films that have been released in the MCU. Good performances from most of the cast, especially from Hemsworth and Hiddleston. An interesting story that has a few faults, as well as a very refreshing Waititi comedic flair that this universe has needed for a while.|  It is not as serious as the others were (Thor, Avengers) .. It has more jokes .. on one side I liked that, on the other I liked that there was a difference between the serious movies and the funny ones (like guardians of the galaxy, which I like as well, ofc)|  Thor: Ragnarok is a buy one get one free of superhero movies- and I'm not totally sure that's a strength in this case. I say that because one of those movies- the story revolving around Thor's cosmic journey where he meets the Hulk and Jeff Goldblum's hilariously Goldblumy character- is actually really good. And on its own, the apocalyptic, pseudo-Norse mythology laden story of Hela would probably have been at least better than either of the other two Thor movies.But they just don't gel. the tone of both stories is just so drastic, that as cool as the Hela stuff is, I couldn't help but want Thor to just stay away from Asgard and have more wacky adventures.And really, that's my biggest complaint- weird pacing aside, it's still a really enjoyable comic book film, and one of Marvel's finest so far. Even in the more serious Asgard sections the movie generally never stops being "fun", and in my opinion that's the point of this type of film.|  Absolutely hilarious! Easily the best Thor so far. Storyline was a bit weak but who cares? I was laughing all the way through.|  While I respect the overhaul the 'Thor' franchise has had to go through, I'm going to have to bemoan several issues such and the tonal inconsistencies; the terribly weak and cliched villain; and some story issues that, while not always illogical, could have been handled better. On the other hand, Ragnarok' was surprisingly funny, and despite how cringe-worthy many of the main characters were, it was easy enough to sit through.|  A big thumbs up from my friends Darragh and I.|  Bloody brilliant. No wonder Marvel Studios are the kings of the cinema screen at the moment because they ace every single movie they make. As a big fan of Taika Waititi's work, I am glad to say we finally have a very good Thor film. The cast work off each other superbly and the villain is probably one of the best we've seen in these films. The humour is great as always and if you don't leave this film with a smile on your face, you are dead inside and need to be checked out.|  Fantastic, easily one of the top 5 Marvel movies so far.|  It's basically a comedy. Not a very good one.|  Hands down the best Thor movie, easily top 5 MCU movies thus far. This movie far surpassed my already high expectations. This is an instant classic in my nerdy mind.|  It seems that Marvel can do no wrong. Another fantastic adventure that adds more great characters and actors to the mix.|  An incredibly fun and enjoyable ride that is easily the best Thor film (though that's not hard) it has a very good style and is very funny this film also takes great use of its already established characters and incredible use if it's new characters (Korg, Valkrie and The Grand Master) I definitely Recommend Thor: Ragranok for any fan of the MCU and good film in general while not the best movie of the year nor best superhero movie it's still good|  FUNNY! Good comedy, action and well written. Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie was Awesome. BEST of Thorn movies so far. Look forward to the next Thorn.|  Have we lowered our standard of good films...|  Best Thor movie even though there are a lot of parts that doesn't make sense. Why did Odin take away Thor's powers for being a jerk in the 1st movie but not Hela? Why did Thor give up on the stones? Why was this Dr. Strange 100% better than the Dr. Strange movie?|  The best Thor movie. Great comedy. Loved it very much|
