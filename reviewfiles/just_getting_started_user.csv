  Starring Morgan Freeman, Tommy Lee Jones with Rene Russo, Jane Seymour, Elizabeth Ashley and an appearance by Johnny Mathis with a script by and directed by Ron Shelton of "Bull Durham", "Tin Cup" and "White Men Can't Jump" how can a movie be this bad? The fact that it wasn't pre-screened for critics, opening cold Friday was sort of a hint that it wasn't good and it isn't. There is about one minute with a limbo contest between Freeman and Jones that may give you a hint of a smile but that is it! Freeman fares the best but that is strictly due to his persona.I seldom, if ever, negative about performers looks but I have to make a few general comments here. Both Freeman and Jones are aging fine up to this point but of the women I wish Elizabeth Ashley hadn't appeared on the screen as I once thought this woman was beautiful but, to me, that's not true anymore. I didn't, gratefully, recognize Jane Seymour during the movie and had to check the credits out to see what part she played.I am not just picking on the women as I am still shaking my head over my 'idol', for many reasons, Johnny Mathis! We are both the same age but he looks 20 years older than he should plus the two songs he sang didn't sound like the Mathis I know.Sometimes a movie is so bad it becomes a cult film but this is so bad it should just disappear and never be shown again!|  when you see big stars it what looks like a silly movie odds are it stinks|  Arguably one of the worst movies of the year.|  Really a 0 star review if I could give it one. I sat there for an hour and did not laugh even once before I walked out. These actors must have been desperate for a paycheck.|  I honestly think this was the worst movie I have ever seen in a theatre. I jumped in on the first day due to the cast but as much as I love Morgan Freeman I despised his character; over-sexed, manipulative, self-indulgent, etc.... No one's character stayed true to themselves during the whole movie so even the one's I started out liking lost me by the end (except Tommy Lee, I liked him less but still had respect for him). So so disappointed. I still don't know what the point of this movie was past mindless entertainment. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were ridiculous. The best thing about the movie was the location/scenery.|  A good cast couldn't redeem this movie. What plot there was, was totally thin and not developed, the ending was anti-climactic and it degenerated very quickly into one long senior citizen sex joke. I never thought I would say this about a movie that Morgan Freeman was in, but this one may get noticed by the Razzies.|  This was just a boring move. It was not funny and had no real story.|  Woof. This was a bad one. All the characters are written bi poler unintentionally and they aren't event slightly developed. The whole movie was just really really bad.|  Tiresome sex farce set in a retirement community.|  Put another one in the Christmas movie column. When you get the likes of Morgan Freeman, Tommy Lee Jones and Rene Russo together, the movie practically drives itself. The strength of "Just Getting Started" is probably in the execution of the vision of a single creator, that being writer / director Ron Shelton of Bull Durham fame. This one is a fairly light comedy. There are some plot holes. How does the bad guy know where to find the rental truck in order to blow it up? Largely due to chemistry of the 3 lead actors, JGS lands somewhere between not too painful and a hilarious time at the movies.|  This was more cringeworthy than that Frozen"short" before Coco.|  One of the worst movies I have ever seen. What a waste of talent. Not one original idea or laugh. I wouldn't even watch it for free on TV|  Great actors ruined by a poor hallmark type movie|  What were these actors thinking when they signed on to this one? Ugh!|  Probably the worst movie I've seen all year|  this was a cute movie...a little slow at times, but a senior movie|  I really enjoyed this. Sure it's mindless fun, but fun none the less.|  ..... I have no words. I know actors do movies out of contractual obligation or just for a paycheck, but do they ever NOT make a movie out of pride?|
