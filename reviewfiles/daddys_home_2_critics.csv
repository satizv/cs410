 A weird, misshapen conglomeration of innocuous juvenile yuks, politically incorrect humor and self-aware comedy punches aimed at the fourth wall.| Though one of the new cast members -- John Lithgow as Ferrell's soft-hearted father -- is a big asset, severe damage is done by another: Mel Gibson as Wahlberg's macho dad. His grimacing performance as a sexist pig deadens every joke it touches.| If you're looking for a crowd-pleasing outing in the run-up to Christmas, you could do a lot worse than Daddy's Home 2, which sees Mel Gibson and John Lithgow joining the blended family fun for this seasonally themed sequel.| It's more of the same, and is probably funnier than the first film, but Daddy's Home 2 is the opposite of subtle and Gibson's performance is bizarre.| Lithgow and Ferrell deliver a smattering of laughs, but they come with a very bitter aftertaste.| A cynical, synthetic piece of Hollywood production line tat, which reheats the narrative leftovers of an already mediocre domestic comedy about blended families.| The smidge of goodwill earned by the first DH turns to coal in this festive sequel, which goes the Meet The Parents route of wheeling out more big-name elders ...| An overcomplicated family premise and too many different characters to care about, each with their own subplot, means this quickly becomes a patchwork quilt of pratfalls and arguments.| A spectacularly unfunny sequel to the fairly mirthless Mark Wahlberg/Will Ferrell Christmas comedy from 2015.| There is nothing surprising about this sequel and some of the characters are positively obnoxious ...| Mostly, it generates its laughs (and in fairness, there are quite a number) with knockabout visual comedy, which is well executed by a strong cast.| This can be a moderately successful film until Mel Gibson shows up and opens his mouth. Or even just smiles.| Daddy's Home 2 is a family film only in the sense that it concerns a family. (It is, in that sense, like the Texas Chain Saw Massacre).| It's a basic rule of entertainment - seemingly ungrasped here - that when Mel Gibson is laughing at something, you are probably not.| (Daddy's Home 2 is) destined for an after-life as an annual Christmas re-run you'll tune in to by accident, only to end up changing the channel or just going to bed.| Double the dads, but half the laughter.| ... Daddy's Home 2 is for the most part thuddingly unfunny and ultimately obnoxious.| Ferrell and Wahlberg make an odd kind of comic team, since they rarely seem to be acting on the same level: Ferrell can hardly bring himself to be sincere, while Wahlberg can hardly be anything but. Still, the combination works.| With the cast in place, Daddy's Home 2 embarks on a disconnected series of sketches and situations that could only be described as a plot by someone who's never looked up the word "plot" in a dictionary. | Ferrell fans will enjoy Daddy's Home 2 but others will find its gloopy sentimentality very hard indeed to digest.|
