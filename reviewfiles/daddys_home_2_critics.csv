 Nobody's heart was in this thing, not even the extremely talented cast, who weren't even phoning their performances in, they just sent a quick text from the toilet.| Right in line with its lackluster predecessor...| Among the performances, all the lead actors show us just why they're big names in Hollywood - Gibson, especially, stands out for his superb portrayal as the sarcastic, womanising senior dad.| Daddy's Home 2 is as creatively bankrupt as the 2015 original. | In which alleged domestic abuser Mel Gibson encourages a child to commit sexual assault.| The clash of styles is imminent, as it is, also, its Christmas resolution.

[Full review in Spanish]| Sure, the first film in 2015 was a global box-office success, but that does not mean it warrants a sequel - and a lame one at that.| The best that can be said for Daddy's Home 2 is that it's slightly less awful than its recent female-led counterpart, A Bad Moms Christmas.| As far as family-friendly seasonal puffery goes it's a very well-handled, pleasant goof-a-rama.| A derivative and a painfully formulaic follow-up which, apart from offering a few scattered laughs, can't seem to find a way to make its set-up fresh enough.| Goes well beyond the typical mindless array of slapstick and humiliation to reach disgusting new depths of coarseness. Not just appalling, but actually dangerous.|
