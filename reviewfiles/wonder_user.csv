  This movie was EXCELLENT, don't see a problem with it but it is at least better than the Emoji Movie. I wasnt expecting it to be like this. You reused actors from odd squad, etc. Thank you (pls send this to the creators)|  Beautiful, heartwarming, inspirational true story. Don't miss it.|  I went with my family.|  This movie made me cry. I loved it!|  I loved nickoloes cage role in this movie|  Predictable but good.|  Wonder is the perfect illustration of the "feel good" movie. The cast is fantastic. But even if Auggie should be and will be the star of the movie for most of you, I feel like Julia Roberts is the shiny diamond here. She is so great that I feel like Owen Wilson is not a fit for the role... I have nothing against Owen Wilson but I felt like he didn't belong the all movie... That said, even if I would label Wonder as a very good movie, not everything is perfect. I was happy the movie ended, I had enough. I don't feel sorry I watched it but I will not watch the movie again, even in 10 years, on TV. That has to do with the fact, that the movie chose the easy path. Of course, a kid with such physical deformities will be rejected at first and accepted because kids are pure. I feel like Wonder 2, Auggie as a teenager, struggling with his hormones at the time appearance matters the most, would be more interesting and more powerful. It doesn't take away the fact that Wonder is a wonderful movie, that should be shown is school and used to debate about prejudice and acceptation of difference. But Wonder is utterly predictable, at least for an adult, and you should know about it!|  Decent enough. It was a little ham handed at times, and I didn't really care for the Chewbacca parts of the film. It would have been interesting to see more of it, or none at all.|  A very touching movie and emotional,shows the reality of the mean people. The Halloween was brilliant|  By so far, this is the most inspirational movie that I have ever watched, telling us that no matter what our looks, where we come from or what ever happens during our school days, we must never give up and keep on hoping, because the world can be a better place if you just look at it from a different angle. I really "Wonder" if the world could be a better place...|  Wonder is directed and co-written by Stephen Chbosky, and it stars Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, and Jacob Tremblay in a drama film about a kid that is going to public school for the first time after being homeschooled for years, and the reason behind that is that August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) is born with Treacher Collins Syndrome, and so the parents let him into middle school where he can hopefully adapt there. When I saw that Stephen Chbosky is making another film, I was interested in it as The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my favorite films, and while this wasn't one of the most anticipated films of the year as there were others that I was looking forward to, I wanted to see this nonetheless. I went to go see this with my mom and her boyfriend, and we unanimously agreed that we absolutely loved this movie. Jacob Tremblay is very likable in this, and doesn't come off as annoying, but has to put in some emotional moments that are very well done, which is a rarity of a kid that age to succeed in that, especially with the make-up which looks impressive and convincing that the character has to go through. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson are great in it that doesn't act in any way embarrassing for the main kid, and they show how much they care about their son given the condition that he's in that'll lead to some problems in school. The writing by Jack Thorne, Steve Conrad, and Stephen Chbosky is well-written that doesn't go to the easy route of just being melodramatic or emotionally manipulative as it builds up the characters that you end up really like and understand what the main kid and some other characters have to go through that you really do feel for them, especially since my mom and her boyfriend were tearing up a lot during this film and I only got teary-eyed in 2 scenes, so the movie is doing something right for the audience. The movie goes in perspectives from the son, the sister, or the friend, and it's interesting to watch from their stories to understand the situation from their point of view. So while this is not as good as The Perks of Being a Wallflower due to personal reasons and the fact that this is one of my favorite films, Wonder is still a fantastic movie that's very heartfelt and funny enough that won't make you depressed while watching this.|  Wonderful movie. Hope it gets nominated and wins awards. It's deserves it.|  Amazing movie,and unforgetttable!!!??????Me and my friend loved it to pieces and it was funny. Good job|  Despite being pretty predictable and falling into a lot of child film tropes, it's got a few inventive moments and a solid cast.|  I loved every pat of this movie tge acting was fantastic and there was so much emotion that made it feel so real.|  it really was inspiring touching emotional and it was 100 percent worth seeing|  Best movie of my life|  This is a must-see for grandparents,parents, teenagers and school age kids, for its sensitive and poignant message concerning how special needs children can and should be helped. The blend of content with excellent acting forms a forceful and touching statement. This film could be useful in schools as a means of dealing with the topics of bullying and adolescence, as well as a model for school administrators who must deal with such issues.|  ???????? ??????. ??? '??????' ????? ??? ???????????????? ??? ??? ? ???????? ?????????? ??? ??? ?????? ?????? ??? ?????? ??? ????????? ??????..|  For me, Wonder was formulaic and a little too "feel good". I didn't count the number of hugs throughout the movie, but they were getting pretty regular by the end to the point of overkill. Still, the main topic covered - which is the cruel nature of kids and the result of ostracized individuals - is important for young audiences, and I'm going to assume this film is mostly for them (which is why I didn't give the movie two stars.) All of the characters are completely lovable to the point of being too perfect. Our heart strings are played in every possible way. You route for the under dogs and rejoice in their unrealistic outcomes.|
