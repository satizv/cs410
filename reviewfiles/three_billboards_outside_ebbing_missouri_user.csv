  One of the worst movies I've seen. Terribly disappointing. Unbelievable characters were spoofed in ways that were not funny and unbecoming of our time.|  One long, continuous, depressing train wreck|  Three Billboards is a film filled with character and genuine emotional depth. It's unconventional and unique approach to plot development help make its' tonal diversity feel more raw and grounded in a way that few films successfully achieve.|  Not sure about this films - there are bits of brilliance - it deals with regret, redemption, justice - but would I watch it again probably not. Can imagine Frances McDormand getting an Oscar nomination.|  The trailer was intriguing. It stops there. The story was very slow and the ending unexceptional. Too bad. This movie had the potential of being a great one. Waste of time.|  This movie was Badass, Backwoods Excellent!|  Some films come out at just the perfect time to be relevant and have a cultural impact. Others come at just the wrong time to feel like a halfhearted attempt at bridging complex and nuanced issues. Three Billboards falls into the latter category. While bolstered by strong performances from a terrific cast, Three Billboards attempts to have its cake and eat it too by preaching for love and forgiveness but also promising bloodshed and revenge, which makes the plot whole filled film bland.|  Easily the worst movie I have ever seen, Dark and depressing with no hope or light at the end of the tunnel. Wanted to leave half way through. Left feeling sick to my stomach|  The humor is obvious, the situations are often stupid and ham-handed, the narrative is tone deaf to America's real problems, and even the premise is dumb. This is a confused, petty, and mean-spirited little movie with a confused message which reveals it is white privilege incarnate as white vigilantism is to be cheered for while in real life many white find black athletes taking a knee problematic.|  This one sort of took me by surprise, I wasn't expecting it to be so violent or poise such questions. Basically a women is overcome with grief and shame over the death of her daughter and the movie explores the things that escalate out of that. Frances McDormand easily ought to be in the running for the major awards, she is that good. Also Sam Rockwell manages to take a basically unsympathetic character and turn it in to a sort of hero. Woody Harrelson is also a standout. The movie poises some very serious questions and, remarkably, does not resolve them. I was very impressed and recommend this but be aware that it is not a feel good movie.|  A physiological and deep film that is an emotional but fun ride. The themes are expertly portrayed through the fabulous characters acted by some terrific performances. The direction and cinematographic techniques make this a gorgeous film to view and the mystery behind it's subtle plot is written superbly. The only negative things that impact the movie in any big way is the needless violence. I'm not offended by it, in fact I adore blood and violence in my films but it seems quite unnecessary. Otherwise, fabulous movie and highly recommended.|  One of the best acted stories I have seen. Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, do such an outstanding work it's worth twice the price to see. It is truly an Oscar winner.|  Terrible movie, offensive, devoid of reality, no like-able characters - really disappointing after reading positive reviews.|  A venture into comedy noir and melodrama, that is at first promising on the themes of today's social issues, by delivering a quota of laughs, but then follows with equivocation. It begins assertively with McDormand looking and acting tough. It goes on to congratulate, and/or chuckle at the characters as they tackle, always improbably, a roll call of big problems: rape, murder, police inaction or impotence, police brutality, racism, disability, discrimination, small town politics, terminal illness, suicide, gay bashing, job loss, advertising, freedom of speech, clerical sexual abuse of children, male ego, midlife crisis, and parenting. It strikes false notes. The screenplay and direction labour too much Dinklage's character's jokes at his own expense. Both Harrelson's character and McDormand's ex-husband are paired with much younger women, the difference being an ego-boost to one, and a caricature for the other - the ageing ex-husband's absurd relationship with a 19 year old ingenue papers over the improbable difference between Harrelson and Cornish. The treatment of Harrelson's character as an elder spirit guide rescues the image of the police - in doing so it renders the film a romantic fantasy. McDormand's character turns out to be negotiable. Compare the harder edges of the characters played by Fonda in Georgia Rule, or Hunter in Strange Weather, the determination of Redgrave's character in Secret Scripture, or Huppert's in Valley of Love, all concerning older mothers dealing with abuse or the loss of their children/grandchildren. Had this screenplay gone further, even in its comedy, instead of smoothing down into niceness and happy endings, it might have been worthy of cult status. The soft-centre approach was not suitable, when applied to so many deep tragedies. The difference between this and the Fonda, Hunter etc. examples, or a classic comedy about discrimination like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, or the cutting satire on exploitation that was The Apartment - is that, in the final result, this show doesn't mean it. It can however be a worthwhile conversation piece - its best feature.|  Wow. Just wow. This is a crazy, wild, unpredictable, at times hilarious, at times chilling, at time violent, and at times emotional roller-coaster of a masterpiece. Best of 2017!|  Love the acting but hated the unrealistic plot and behavior. The swearing was over the top and not every character needs to swear all the time.|  A black comedy that is actually funny at times while at the same time gripping with terrific acting, its truly one of my favorites of the year so far. Sam Rockwell... you especially truly did a marvelous job as playing your character, real entertaining watch.|  Sad film with good acting but no end... don't waste your time...|  A poignant view into a mother's anger and desperate search for closure. Three billboards draws strong performances from key actors. The end is a bit too easy (almost lazy) but a good script and film overall|
