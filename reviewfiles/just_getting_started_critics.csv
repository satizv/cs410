 This wheezy romantic caper ... inspires little more than melancholy reminiscences of Mr. Shelton's earlier work.| "Just Wrapping Up" any career in comedy is more like it. | The problem with this tepid, senior-centric Christmas comedy is that it never really gets going. It's seasonal sludge.| ...nobody -- not the audience, and certainly not the cast -- deserves a clunker like this.| A rather lazy boondoggle by Shelton, who waited 14 years to direct again and didn't bother to make it worthwhile.| Just Getting Started simply never does get started. It's D.O.A.| Ron Shelton's lame comedy is an utterly useless misfire that brings out the worst in all parties involved.| The film is ingratiating enough, but its main value is to make us eager for another, more substantial Shelton movie long before another decade has slipped by.| Even a cast with this many award wins and nominations can't salvage a script that will have viewers audibly sighing, rather than laughing.| This mild and dawdling picture is the sort of trifle meant for a retirement-age audience who just want to spend a pleasant and uneventful hour-and-a-half with a few name actors of a certain age. There's very little comedy here and even less action.| Tonally bizarre, lazily performed, and deeply unfunny.| Everyone involved in the making of Just Getting Started should be charged with war crimes. Okay, that's obviously just a joke, but my gosh, what an endurance test this movie is. |
