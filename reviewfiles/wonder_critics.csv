 Despite the narrative we are conditioned to expect, this film isn't all about Auggie. It is in the overlapping narratives from his peers that we see the true message.| This is a truly inspired and wonderful movie that celebrates love, compassion, empathy, diversity and the triumph of tolerance over hatred, envy, jealousy and those who would abuse their power.| [Jason] Tremblay was wonderful in Room and he is again here, [Julia] Roberts is suitably fierce, [Owen] Wilson keeps it low key.| With verisimilitude, outstanding acting from its central and supporting cast, and a surprisingly gritty undertone beneath the melodrama and sentient multifaceted perspectives, Wonder succeeds in creating an honest portrayal of an uncommon life situation.| Wonder is a family-friendly movie boasting a message of acceptance that both children and adults can, and should, get behind| Directed with nobility and a brilliant cast, it is a moving film.
