  I like the movie but was not crazy about the "twist" in the end. The concept/ idea behind it was good though. Would recommend watching.|  It maybe a remake and I never saw the original classic movie. I like all the cast and crew, I know they can act. The story was a little thin, the lead actor, had trouble carrying the movie.|  Kenneth Branaghs latest recreation of the movie not only brings joy to the viewer to see this story on the big screen with wonderful actors , amazing sets and epic cinematography , but also finally created a poirot who's not just comical for the die hard agatha cristie fans|  Incredible film - loved every minute. The cinematography was exquisite, Kenneth Branagh formidable and loveable, the rest of the cast a selection of unique and perfect characters, and the story full of suspense to the final minute.|  A film with caricature performances but that amuse, script that intrigues but it does not stop seeming a great script of series, in spite of being inspired in the great book of Agatha Christie, and a good direction. Agatha Christie's books full of mysteries, intrigues and twists are phenomenal, a pity that today would hardly work in a visual audio work, the fault of the thousands of series that do this, perhaps not always with the same perspicacity, years and 24 episodes per season, so the whole mood of the mystery of the movie nowadays is almost trivialized by the infinity of similar audiovisual works, even though it may not contain the same charm. The film pinpoints attempts to address social issues but does not focus on it, the focus is all centered even on the unfolding narrative of the murder in question, and that is a good thing. The film has a very good direction, almost all happening in a claustrophobic train with narrow walls and tiny rooms, the director arranges subterfuges to gain space in the train and to show its history completely, for example, the great cameras with vision panoramic view from above, or the sequential plans lining up characters, besides having a beautiful photograph, but a rhythm that makes the viewer feel too much the floor of the film. With a spectacular cast, it's hard to say anything negative about the film's performances, but even with a magic cast, we do not have any masterpiece in terms of acting, but Kenneth Branagh does well as Hercule Poirot. The film changes some details in book relations, many serve and crutch for character development, and some are very well developed and others not, the film deals with justice and reminds of glimpses up to spectacular "twelve men and one sentence" in the final speech , but it's just a fun and enjoyable movie.|  I absolutely adored this movie, the cast portrayed their respective actors wonderfully. In my opinion, this was one of the very few instances where the movie is better than the book.|  Despite my high hopes and the slick production, the performance falls flat, Branagh is a dubious Poirot for anyone who loves A. Christie books. Its hard to like him as Poirot and harder to feel he is hitting the right notes. The big name cast is poorly used and suspense is left out in the cold. A disappointing adaptation of a classic.|  3 - a little hard to take the main character seriously when you have a moustache and accent like detective poirot does. but regardless, twas an entertaining movie, even if the final solution is a bit ridiculous and far fetched|  Predictable as it is, and not quite as appealing as the 1974 adaptation, this version still works thanks to a creepy atmosphere, realistic background and brilliant performances.|  An all-star thud of a dud. Branagh loving Branagh. (12-9-17)|  I might not be the fairest to judge this film, since I've been an ardent admirer of the Lumet version since my childhood. Nevertheless, I do appreciate Branagh for his other adaptations of classical literature (and his truly marvellous audiobook record); not to mention Dafoe, Dench and Jacobi, all solid performers - and Depp as well, when he's allowed to play more than some eccentric traits.Of course, Patrick Doyle aboard as usual - and, among other features, his score is one of the greatest disappointments in this film, so much that I sincerely wonder what had happened? Doyle who created such beautiful music for Henry V, epic without being ostentatious, or the large-scale, monstrous (pun intended) score for Frankenstein (a brilliant example that it does not have to sound like the usual Hollywood mishmash pot which seems to serve for every new blockbuster); and many more with a sense of delicate sensibility bereft of any wet or heavy sentimentalism, just in the tradition of his countrymen composers... Perhaps, the unimpressive and absolutely non-substantial quality of the score for this film (which I can only explain with Doyle having had some issues in the creation process) could be called just characteristic of the overall weakness of this film.It was foreseeable (and I did expect it) that with Branagh starring Branagh, the whole would be a bit like "Hamlet" with a massive mustache soliloquizing in a train compartment, instead of the court chamber. However, despite his Poirot demonstrating his love for balance in an extensive introduction, the film lacks of it in such huge amounts that even an amateur like myself can't overlook it (by the way, the necessity of such an indulgent overture remains as questionable as the location it took place, as well as some uncalled-for modifications which turn even comical in its banality - like the "confession" of the character played by Dafoe). And for my liking, this Poirot was trying too hard to adopt the manners of his English colleague, although Christie had saved it for her 'young' Tommy Beresford to mimic the great Sherlock Holmes.Without going into details, the whole film should perhaps have been called "An attempt to turn an entertaining whodunnit into a Shakespearean tragedy", or, simply: "Hamlet-on-Train".This might very much sum up what it's about: We have the Shakespearean protagonist trying to infuse some depth (with added details which just feel out of place and even out of character, considering Christie's setup for Poirot's personal history) into the story line of a boulevard article-sensational nature, living from the plot rather than psychological observation. The effort of turning this into a Poirot characterisation in all seriousness and showcasing his personal emotional drama, might be worth the acknowledgement for its new approach to the egg-headed comical figure - but in the end, neither the vessel nor the rest of the wan supporting characters lacking any bit of uniqueness do offer enough space nor material for such an undertaking.It does not help that the focus on one hero shifts the spotlight from the actual subject of the whole matter - the idea of the collective, the distinguishing feature and core of the story. This film is another example that adding 'eccentric' (rather exaggerated) traits to some of the characters does not automatically induce uniqueness. A really wasted and misrepresented example is the couple Andrenyi - it remains a mystery to me why the Count should've been shown as an utterly unsympathetic, psychotic character, even with his personal tragedy counted in. The actor could've been put in a much more dignified light and he certainly deserved it. As it is, the Count and the Countess were shown like some hippie drug-addicts rather suited to the stage of Moulin Rouge.Very Branagh, but this time, Victor fought against a windmill, despite all his energetic endeavours.PS. The only scene which showed that the film could've had some potential - were it perhaps set in a completely modern environment, with a bunch of 'normal folk' on a casual train without any claim for luxury nor exclusivity, running somewhere unspectacular on the European continent - was the cake 1:1 battle between Depp and Branagh. It was the only moment that really caught my attention and I found myself enjoying it, as I would expect from a "good film" (and had done so for this one prior to watching). That small glimpse of spark alone earned 2,5 stars.As it is, I wonder where the budget went into - not the train for sure; the lengthy egg-quest and King Solomon-wannabe trial at the beginning? Branagh might want to try this as a revised stage play version, it would distract less from the intense suspence and power play that should occur between the characters. I might very much wish to watch him performing in the RSC...|  Agatha Christie's revered classic gets a snowy CGI facelift in this hyper-stylised stinker. Director-cum-hipster-Poirot, Kenneth Branagh, leads an all-star cast all-aboard the titular train. A murder occurs, mumbo jumbo ensues and a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes enable each star to drop a couple of bad one-liners before Branagh reveals who's the baddy.Fortunately, along the this long journey to nowhere, there's plenty of eye-popping distractions to help the heavy-nonsense narrative fade into the background. These include: a CGI Jerusalem, a CGI Istanbul, a CGI train and a non-CGI (but equally false-looking) moustache. And a woman whose face appears to be made from marzipan.At the centre of this BRIGHT WHITE disasterpiece, however, lies one great mystery: who the fuck is the audience is supposed to be?|  One of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Wish I would have listened to the reviews.|  I liked it. The star casting is superb. Kenneth directing and acting skills are amazing. Well done Kenneth.|  I enjoyed it. I knew the story well, and enjoyed the modern twist. I thought it was wonderfully acted and shot with some incredible casting. It was a different kind of poriot and was pretty stylish. Enjoyable murder mystery|  A well-kept ensemble propelled by period drama panache and spot-on style, albeit less sleuthing.|  La pelcula tiene un principio aburrido y en mi opinin torpe, de hecho me dorm poco despus de empezar la investigacin. Tiene un ritmo lento y pesado hasta que la investigacin avanza, y es ah donde arranca de verdad la pelcula, con dilogos interesantes aunque demasiado enrevesados. La historia que cuenta no es tan asombrosa como me esperaba, cre que iba a ver un caso impresionante y tampoco era para tanto.Kenneth Brannagh se me hace bastante pesado y no he logrado conectar con l. Por suerte se cargan al personaje de Johnny Depp pronto, porque cada vez odio ms a este actor. El resto del elenco es funcional, pero me parece que desperdicia a la cantidad de estrellas que tiene. As como la actuacin de Kenneth Brannagh no fue mi favorita, s lo fue su direccin, con planos arriesgados en el tren y con un manejo de la cmara dentro del mismo alucinante, que daba el dinamismo a la pelcula que el guin no tena. Me decepcion, pero no creo que sea una mala pelcula, solo que me pareci que de tan elegante que se crea era pretenicosa, algo que no consigo soportar.|  a water down suspense film|  It helped I didn't know the story so my 12 year old and I really enjoyed it and trying to guess who did it. Different then the same old Marvel stuff.|  Fabulous old fashioned crime drama. Fun to watch, excellent performances, and beautifully filmed, pure escapism. Really clever plot. Great winter escape film.|
