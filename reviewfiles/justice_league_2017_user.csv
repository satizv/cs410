  Just like batman V Superman Critics are wrong, and lets hope Affleck continues to play Batman|  It was boring, attempted to be nostalgic like the comics but is not even close to being a historical superhero film. Too many scene changes and no build up with characters. just felt like I was watching a YouTube video with fighting parts and that's it.|  The movie is an excellent launching point for the extended DC universe. It was fun and action-packed. The best of Snyder was left in with the whimsy of Whedon added. It certainly deserves comics fans' attendance and support. The first appearance of Batman looked like he flew in straight from a Frank miller graphic novel. Despite his limited screen time, we got the actual Superman - a turn for the better. Supporting league members added unique color. And how can you lose with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman? Go see it again!|  loved it, great family fun|  We'll Done, the added humor was a big plus|  This movie isn't great, but it's def a step in the right direction for the dceu, if it's not too late......|  I have been a comic book collector for over 30 years, as well as a superhero fan. I genuinely consider myself an expert, I really need to say this was a great movie. I completely disagree with the supposed critics, who I'm sure have no clue to the true origin and fascination that we had us kids with comic books and superheroes.|  Loved itt!! I just enjoyed the ensemble cast! Wish it could have lasted longer. My fave DC superheros all in one place. Loved the humour, even the dark colours. Can't wait for a Wonder Woman2. Auqaman, Flash, and Cyborg movie. Loved the theme of hope. We have very little of it in the world today. This is a feel good movie in every sense of the word. I know there were two different directors, but that seemed to work for the better. Good Show!|  In few words: Pretentious and Disconnected, but with Action.Compared to most movies out, this is worth seeing. However, go with really low expectations. Unlike recent Marvel movies, the heroes aren't personable. They are presented visually and act pretentious. Most movies set up judgments in the first scene and either overcome or support it throughout. In Justice League, the first scene has Superman towering over, and being bothered by kids fawning over him. The camera angle and misaligned voice timing adds to the pretentiousness. The rest of the film only supports this first impression with made-for-cgi-cut-scenes movements of characters either turning their head or standing up or posing for the camera.The movie was likely edited so much that they storyline lacks background, character building, or even sharing information. They accept transporter columns appearing in thin air, zombie creatures who smell fear and other otherwise disbelieveable elements without batting an eye. Or, come up with a crazy plot "just touch a lightning bolt to the box the moment it hits the water," without a second thought because "I ran the numbers."I felt like someone took a nice comic book and ripped out all but the most visually dramatic pages, leaving a disconnected story remaining.Then, again, it's better than some other action new releases (after Marvel, at the moment). Worth seeing, just not believing.|  Nice movie, the only flaw is to give too much attention to sups.|  Better than other DC nonsense, but still too dark and over reliant on unrealistic, bombastic effects. The best parts of the movie are simple Batman fight scenes.|  Justice League was absolutely awesome I loved every single minute of it. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I love all the characters. the action scenes are epic. And I found the main villain absolutely badass. Now there is a few moments where I was let down by the CGI in the movie, but other then that it was epic. you should stop whatever you're doing and go see it.|  Esse filme da Liga deveria ser 2 filmes de duas horas e meia de durao, como os executivos da warner no manjam nada disso colocaram tudo em um filme de 2 horas, ou seja, os 40% da Rotten Tomatoes faz mais sentido ainda.|  Totally worth seeing!|  The movie has a few missteps, but I found it to ultimately bring to me a renewed faith for DC's shared universe. I didn't go in expecting a picture of the year, but I went in hoping to see the Justice League- and that's exactly what we got. Ezra Miller, Gal Gadot, and Jason Momoa absolutely nail their respective roles, with each bring a unique and surprising take on the icon that they portray. The rest of the cast is a little more inconsistent, but generally at least enjoyable. Ultimately, the film is an assembly of heroes. When complaining about Justice League's plot, people fail to remember that the widely popular 2012's The Avengers also had a very barebones plot, serving instead to simply bring the heroes together for some big action set pieces. Of course, merely copying Marvel wouldn't be a wise move for DC at this point, but I also think it's a bit unfair to say that this film did nothing story-wise. While the Steppenwolf story is pretty underdeveloped, and Darkseid is strangely barely even teased, the individual characters do get some significant personal arcs that I expect we'll see develop over the next several years. Justice League far exceeds what I'd expected of it as a DC film, and while that really isn't saying much, I did find it to be genuinely enjoyable.|  Decent movie that lacked zing and pep. Tried to be more than it needed to be. DC...please just do what you did with Wonder Woman|  Is not perfect, but the characters are great and, let's be honest. Who doesn't want to see the JUSTICE LEAGUE on the big screen?|  Best superhero movie ever!!!!!|  i loved,i can see why people didnt like it,it does feel rushed but its still a great movie|  Once again a huge buildup but they fell short.|
