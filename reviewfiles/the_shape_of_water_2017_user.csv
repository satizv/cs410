  The shape of water is a deep,wonderful, romantic tale. Laugh, cry, love, hate, cringe- a really good holiday movie. It stayed with me for days because like a typical del Toro movie it hits on many different levels of feelings.|  A twisted take on Disney's "Splash". Nudity and sex so don't take the little ones.|  Charming film, but a little to blatant on playing to the Oscar voters for my taste. Sally Hawkins puts in another great performance. CDW|  Just saw this last night. Next to Lady Bird, one of my favorites of the year. Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Shannon give fantastic performances and the story is moving and somewhat timely. Highly recommended.|  Good story, great performances, really amazing set design and cinematography. Del Toro's bizarro 1950s setting and characters verge on parody, but all in all, pretty good overall. Not Pan's Labyrinth good, however.|  As profound, affecting, and humorous a period cold war era, sci-fi, fantasy, love story, fairy tale can be, along with a taste of monster ABA therapy for good measure.|  Loved this movie. The style, humor and storyline was wonderful. All the cast were top notch.|  THE SHAPE OF WATER was magical and beautifully dreamlike but Octavia Spencer cast as a 1960s maid, yet again, was very off-putting for me.|  An amazingly creative artistic film. Sally Hawkins delivers a spectacular and powerful performance, with Doug Jones bringing life and love to the 'Other.' It's another fantastic movie by Guillermo del Toro.|  If you've ever been in love or never been in love, The Shape of Water will make you fall in love. Magical, beautiful, awesome movie.|  Full of fantastic cinematography, taboo aquamarine desires, and a magical and endearing story, The Shape of Water is Guillermo Del Toro's latest dark fantasy film... now with some romance involved. We have seen the imaginative heights of this man, but masterpieces such as Pan's Labyrinth were just the beginning. His touch of imagination brings an incomparable story, unique to anything you've seen before, told in a gorgeous atmosphere by a talented cast.Besides working in a top-secret laboratory Elisa (Sally Hawkins), doesn't have much going for her. Her days are repetitive and only brightened by the presence of her neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins) and her co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer). But her life changes when one day she and Zelda discover a secret classified experiment, one that will make her feel what she has been waiting for, and place her under multiple risks she will need to overcome.Every aspect of the film is full of magic and sweetness. The cinematography is flawless and gives the film a touch of nostalgia. The set design is one of the best seen this year and combined with the music, they create a unique atmosphere for the film. The main character of Elisa has a lovely personality with her sincerity and joyfulness being contagious. She is what makes the film and the relationship between her and the creature of the sea enthralling instead of forbidden.Guillermo Del Toro has created a story that is as bizarre as it is beautiful and as romantic as it is heartbreaking. It is incredible to see three extremes, horror, fantasy, and romance mixed so beautifully in a film. Guillermo Del Toro has always excelled at storytelling and the Shape of Water is just another excellent example of this.|  The shape of water is visually spectacular but the love story (beast and human) has been done several times. It is also good that the movie approaches several hot topic like homophobia, racism, etc.. but contrary to all those excellent critics I found it overall as acceptable but magnificent.|  unbelievably silly ridiculous movie.|  'The Shape of Water' is the closest thing we got to visual poetry in 2017 and I absolutely adored every second of it. Guillermo del Toro has made a masterful, gorgeous fairy tale for adults and we are lucky to have his talents in the world.|  Guillermo del Toro has put enough unconventional spins on this narrative to overcome the story's potential predictability. Making the heroes a group of marginalized outcasts was a true stroke of genius.|  Though at times a little predictable, this inventive fantasy/fairy tale delivers the goods with superb special effects, gentle humor, heartwarming sincerity, and a host of excellent performances, especially by Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins. Think "Beauty and the Beast" meets "E.T.," and you've got a good idea what's going on here. It's so satisfying to see a film that truly lives up to its pre-release hype.|  Truly bad. A shell of a film... I?m genuinely pissed that 2 hours of my life was wasted on this. PS - I loved Pan?s Labyrinth.|  Full frontal female masturbation followed by sex with a sea creature followed by them jumping into the ocean and living happily ever after. Some other stuff probably happened too, can't quite recall.|  You haven't seen a romance like director Guillermo del Toro's latest monster mash (monster smash?), The Shape of Water. del Toro, an aficionado of cinematic creepy crawlies, has swerved from big-budget studio fare into a smaller, stranger period romance between a woman and an amphibious creature who already arrives pre-lubricated (I apologize already for that joke). I was compelled to watch The Shape of Water twice to better formulate my thoughts, mostly because I was not expecting the movie to be so enthusiastically whimsical, adult, and romantic, and the best beauty and the beast tale of this year.Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a lonely mute woman working on the cleaning staff at a classified government laboratory. Her neighbor, Giles (Richard Jenkins), is a hopeless romantic trying to find his place in the world as a gay man. Her best friend, Zelda (Octavia Spencer), is supportive but thinks they should mind their own business. An Amphibian Man (Doug Jones) from the Amazon is confined to a cell and repeatedly beaten by Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), the vile head of security at the station. They believe the creature's ability to breathe underwater and on land will be the key to winning the space race. The scientist in charge, Dr. Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), is secretly a Russian spy, though his allegiances are more to the fragile creature than any country. Elisa teaches the creature sign language, the joys of hard boiled eggs, and lots of cheery music. She also falls in love with the creature and grows determined to save the Amphibian Man by breaking him loose.From the get go, del Toro drops us into a world that is not our own, as he's so skilled at doing. This version of 1960s Baltimore feels as though it's the twentieth century equivalent of a fairy tale village, and our monster is also the princess in need of rescue. Our heroine has a strange scar that foreshadows her place of belonging. The entire film bristles with a sense of expertly curated magic realism even though there isn't anything explicitly magical. The supernatural and fantastical are met with a casual acceptance, as they would be in any storybook legend of old. When Elisa discovers the Amphibian Man in his tank, it's literally at the ten-minute mark or even earlier, and she is unfazed. She immediately accepts the existence of this scaly mere-man, establishes a line of communication, and befriends the creature. It's as if del Toro is trying to prime the audience for what's to come and hoping to skip over the intermediate waiting period of incredulity. For del Toro, the real fun is once the characters connect, and belaboring that necessary connection is not in the audience's best interests or time.The movie glides by on effusive outpouring of charm, given such vibrant, sweeping life thanks to del Toro's repertoire of pop-culture influences and his passionate love of cinema. The Shape of Water feels like del Toro and co-writer Vanessa Taylor (Hope Springs) took one of the old Universal horror B-movies and decided to make it into one of the most personal, delightful, and curious filmgoing experiences of the year. It's film as escape for society's outsiders. The sense of whimsy is ever-present without being overpowering or diluting the drama. It never feels quirky for its own sake of satisfaction. You'll recognize several of del Toro's artistic references, the re-purposing of cultural artifacts, but the magic suffused within every frame is thanks to del Toro and his team of filmmaking artists. If Amelie was going to fall in love with a sea creature, it might look something like this The Shape of Water.The movie is also surprisingly, refreshingly adult in its depiction of human beings. Again the opening minutes set a standard of what to expect. We get a sense of Elisa's daily routine before leaving for work, and one crucial component involves furious masturbation in her bathtub (set to an egg timer for sport?). This is a far more sensual movie than I was ever anticipating. There are multiple sequences of Hawkins disrobed and offering herself to the Amphibian Man. We never see any underwater action but we do hear about some of the mechanics of how the coupling is even remotely possible physically ("Never trust a man," Zelda chuckles upon hearing those dirty details). It's not all sexy time indulgences. There's a sharp undercurrent of very real and very upsetting violence, typified by Strickland's ruthless determination to break the creature. He's a Bible-thumping sadist generally dismissive of those he finds different and lesser and yet he's drawn to Elisa. Why is that? Because she's a diminutive woman who cannot talk, and this sexually excites him like nothing else. He even comes on to her, thinking his interest is a form of masculine charity. There are some shocking moments of very real violence and its lingering effects. Strickland's on-the-job injury becomes a metaphorical moral gauge for the putrid character's state of being. The Shape of Water is a movie that does not blunt anything, whether it's the sexuality or violence of its story (beware pet lovers: this is the second 2017 entry where an amphibian being hidden from the government eats somebody's house cat). This is a fable for adults, a grimy Grimm's tale with a sprinkle of Old Hollywood sparkle.The Shape of Water is also a deeply romantic and earnest love story about two outsiders finding a connection in the most unlikely of places. Engineering a story that pushes two oddball characters together, each finally finding a kindred spirit, is an easy recipe for a satisfying conclusion; however, their romantic connection has to feel rightly earned. If we don't believe the characters have fallen for one another, that this potential relationship elevates their existence, that the colors of the world seem brighter when around this person, then it doesn't work. You have to buy the love story and it must be earned. Amazingly, del Toro is able to craft a love story with a mute woman and an Amphibian Man that checks most of the boxes of Hollywood romantic escapism. Elisa has an openhearted way of looking at the world, and her acceptance provides her with a bravery few others have. The creature presents somebody who views her not as a woman with a disability, as something lesser, but as something whole and wholly fulfilling. Everyone wants to be truly seen by someone for who they are rather than what they're not.While del Toro is supremely skillful at making Elisa's romantic yearnings felt, there is one inherent weakness in this girl-meets-fish dude tale of love. The Amphibian Man isn't really much of a character and far more of a symbol to the other characters. To Elisa, he's her hope. To Giles, he's a wild animal. To Strickland, he's a defiant challenge to be tamed. To Zelda, he's the questionable new boyfriend for her pal. To Hoffstetler, he's a beautiful creature. To the U.S. government, he's a potential scientific breakthrough. To the Soviets, he's a liability and a potential future weapon. We're told the indigenous people of the Amazon worshiped the Amphibian Man as a god but ultimately he remains a cipher others project onto. The love story feels a little too one-sided from an audience investment perspective. Still, the romance works and that fact alone is incredible considering the unique pairing.Hawkins (Maudie) is the beating heart of the movie and delivers a wonderfully expressive portrait of a woman finding her voice, so to speak. She's relatively upbeat and that fits the whimsical tone of the picture. Hawkins plays a woman excited by the possibilities of the world. She reminded me of Bjork's tragic heroine from 2000's Dancer in the Dark, a woman who saw the extraordinary in ordinary life, who could perceive a symphony of music just on the outer edges of everyone else's hearing. Going completely wordless for the movie, save for one very memorable fantasy sequence, requires a lot of daunting physical acting from Hawkins, and she's more than up to the task. I guarantee a scene where she tearfully forces Giles to say out loud her signing will be her Oscar nomination clip.When we talk about the weird and wild promise of cinema, it takes a controlled, assured vision and precise execution to bring together the dispirit elements and allow them to coalesce into something that feels like a satisfying, mesmerizing whole. The Shape of Water is del Toro's gooey love letter to monster movies while stepping outside of homage and into the realm of something daring and different. I could talk about the Busby Berkley musical number as declaration of love, or that the story is told from socially marginalized voices finding an affinity together, or the small character moments that give generous life to supporting figures like Zelda and Hoffstetler, or that it leaves implied stories to be chewed over for extra richness like Giles likely being outed at his work to the dismay of his closeted superior, or the perfect casting for secondary antagonists, or the exquisite cinematography that seems to utilize every shade of green the human eye is capable of seeing, or the stunning production design, or the sweetly eccentric whistling musical score by Alexadre Desplat, or the grace of Doug Jones' performance in the amphibian suit, or just how funny this movie can be, even the sadistic villain. I could talk about all that stuff but I'll simply condense it all to a plea to give The Shape of Water a chance. It's rare to see a storytelling vision this precise that's also executed at such a high degree of difficulty. In other hands, this could have been an unholy mess. With del Toro, it's a lovely mess.Nate's Grade: A-|  Genre blender with magic, mystery, humor and emotional thrills, a memorable tale - created with such precision its essence is like hearing a newly discovered musical instrument. More than beauty and the beast - a fable which explores love, dignity, passion, and everything worth taking the plunge. If you liked: Amelie, Black Mirror|
