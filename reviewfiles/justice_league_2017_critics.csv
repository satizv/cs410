 pretty much exactly what you would expect the follow-up to Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2015) to be, except a good half hour shorter, which is perhaps its greatest quality| Is it an improvement from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice? Absolutely, but the same flaws persist, including new ones. Thankfully, the Justice League themselves are a fun bunch to be around, | Full of action and some much needed humor, "Justice League" is an entertaining two-hour roller coaster ride | For all the fracas, this is a curiously inert piece of action filmmaking. The dialogue borders on the cheesy with intermittent leaps headlong into the cheddar. | The gritty nature of the world of DC is worth the price of admission.| All of Snyder's DC films - Justice League included - seem more concerned with the repercussions of actions than with the actions themselves.| Ultimately, all this makes Justice League the superhero movie some fans feel they deserve but not the one other fans needed-especially fans who prefer their tales to grow with them. | It's an even messier saga than Dawn of Justice, with a tiresome and whiskery macguffin in which three magic boxes must be brought together for evil, then prised apart for good. | ... the Justice League works in an acceptable manner as that highly anticipated reunion of the great DC heroes... [Full review in Spanish]| Not even all of Batman's money is able to save this disaster from collapsing. [Full Review in Spanish]| A hasty, disjointed assemblage of two conflicting visions; a bad movie fused to a different bad movie.| Where "Man of Steel" and "BvS" were like root canals, and "Suicide Squad" a brick in the face, and "Wonder Woman" a sweet, sweet rainbow, "Justice League" is merely a squandering of time and talent. | Man, oh man, does this movie look bad.| The most impressively, faultlessly mediocre and boring and pointless A-list superhero film going back through the nearly 40 years of modern superhero films.| Justice League should be seen as a step forward for the DCEU. The two hours runtime makes it flow better, and the level of entertainment is high enough as to ignore its faults. [Full review in Spanish]| Given the generic state of the plot and how uninteresting the characters are, Justice League wasn't worth the trouble.| ... this engaging-even endearing-superhero movie in its brisk two hours is faster and funnier than both Man of Steel and the would-be opera of what could be called Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Superman's Funeral.| The characters save the film from being a complete and utter disaster, but they alone can't save it from being a mild disaster.| Justice League does not achieve the impact that other films of its style have reached. [Full Review in Spanish]| More relatable than its predecessor but no more spell-binding, Justice League races through its paces and ends: four hours of exposition and posturing stuffed in a two-hour package.|
