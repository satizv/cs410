  No stars. This is a heap of steaming, masturbatory trash. The fact that this held a 100% rating for so long, and that an entire article was written calling out the first person who "dared" give it less than five stars speaks volume about the ignorance and arrogance of Hollywood in 2017.|  Pretty good. Well written and acted. Not a classic by any standard. Who are these critics, besides being well paid shills?|  This is a movie without much plot but instead watching a realistic coming of age movie. I like this movie for its subtle and dry humor. This was well done and I would watch it again and again.|  4.0/5.0 stars - Grade: B+|  Fun, fresh take on adolescence and mother/daughter relationships, and an enjoyable film.|  Brilliantly written. Hilarious and heartbreaking. Without a doubt the best movie I saw in 2017.'Lady Bird' brought to the table a coming-of-age story that doesn't embrace every single cliche about growing up in the United States, particularly California. It was so refreshing to see a story about a teenager that embraces her dry sense of humor and her creativity. I truly enjoyed Saoirse Ronan's performance alongside Laurie Metcalf. If I wasn't aware that Ms. Ronan was raised in Ireland and spoke with a thick accent off-screen, I genuinely would have believed she was from Sacramento.Greta Gerwig presented us with a beautiful story that willfully acknowledges the strains of growing up in the early 2000's while living on a shoestring budget with a dysfunctional family. The angst was believable, the suppressed sexual tension between the students was just like being back in high school again, and the beginning of her college journey could bring a tear to anyone's eye. Gerwig gave us one of the most realistic portrayals of a coming-of-age story I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I applaud every single member of this cast and crew. Such a beautiful movie with a great message that's conveyed in a brilliant manner. Not to mention one of the most aesthetically beautiful films about California in the last 20 years. The fact that there wasn't one shot of Los Angeles made this film so much more believable and fun.I've already seen it three times in theaters.|  Overhyped movie with nearly no skilled cinematography, felt it was a dull story as well..|  family dynamic and the struggles of puberty|  "Lady Bird" is the most unlikable character. Did not enjoy this film.|  "Lady Bird" is an inspiring, emotional movie that captures the essence of being a teenager! It hits in all the right places, and is truly a great experience! I encourage anyone to see this movie!|  Lady Bird is good film not a great film. Funny where it needs to be and sad in it's emotional catharsis. It's underlying theme is "human fear". Silence and secrets abound in this suburban universe. A visiting alien would conclude that all humans are liars. The drama here is how each lie is controlled and covered up by its owner. Buried in each character is the suppressed fear of a personal reality and we watch it bust out of the human seem in inappropriate ways. The redeeming qualities of the film are the honest expressions of truth that most characters in the film find so frightening. Life is full of practical jokes which are amplified by adolescence. Lady Bird calls us to "tell" the truth by showing the ridiculous consequences of our "don't tell' society.|  Great movie until the end, lost it's rhythm|  This movie is disrespectful and this girl clearly has mental problems being rude to her mother and embarrassed she didn't have a huge home. The movie lacks a good story line with a positive message.|  It is the time of year that Hollywood seems to stockpile the better movies, and Lady Bird is one of those films. Maybe it is that this film speaks to me, as many of the circumstances that occur in the movie, I just went through. The film is about a high school senior and her last year at a Catholic high school. She wants out of Sacramento, and she has a very tenuous relationship with her mom. Well my daughter just finished high school and moved across the country to go to college, just like Saoirse Ronan's character in this movie. This movie just feels real, and is pretty dang funny. The interaction between Ronan and her friends and family just rings true. While this film is going to be in the Oscar hunt on a few different levels, it is too bad it hasn't been released at a different time of year so that the film could appeal to a wider audience. Go seek this film out, especially if you have/had teenage children, you will be glad you did.|  My wife and I checked out the indie Oscar hopeful Lady Bird. Lady Bird is the nickname of a young woman who's transitioning to adulthood from her Catholic High School. What follows is your traditional dramedy coming-of-age story. The story zips along with numerous episodes where Lady Bird struggles with fitting in, evolving friendship, sexual awaking, etc. However, at the core of the transition is her mixed relationship with her mother. Laurie MetCalf (Roseanne, Big Bang Theory) does a great job as the mother. The comedy emerges naturally from the story. The movie does end abruptly which may displease some viewers. The actors are fine and Saoirse Ronan as Lady Bird shines throughout. The movie seemed unusually "grainy" and the cinematography seemed somewhat flat. Overall, it was a nice movie. The buzz around it, much like the film "Get Out", seems overblown. My wife seemed to like it a bit more than me.|  Writer/Director/Actor Greta Gerwig hops behind the camera for the critically acclaimed Lady Bird, a coming of age tale about a young high school kid played by Saoirse Ronan. While the film offers what some might consider an accurate portrayal of life in Sacramento circa 2002 (considering Gerwig was raised there), it ultimately remains rooted to the ground as a pretty ho-hum offering, much like the city it was shot in. Let's not get this twisted, though. Ronan was a great casting addition as Lady Bird (Christine). Her American accent was flawless, and the 23-year-old did not have to backtrack much to play a 17-year-old teenager on the cusp of graduating and going to college. It's just a shame her story was relatively bland. This will certainly vary from audience member to member, but I had no relations with the main character as a white, Jewish, and moderately affluent kid raised in a much larger city. I could easily separate my situation from hers to at least enjoy the film, but it certainly led me down a thought process of just wanting to see positive things happen for Lady Bird instead of worrying about sharing any emotions with the character. The strength of this story lies in the cast of her family. Laurie Metcalf and Tracy Letts put on a show, especially when it comes to their relationship with Lady Bird. Most mothers and daughters will easily relate to the tightly-wound relationship these two have with each other that runs hot and cold at the flick of a switch. I won't call this one of the best films of the year because I still think there are other directors who tackle coming-of-age stories better. Ronan's Lady Bird spits fire and is an excitable character to follow and see succeed from her climb out of adolescence into adulthood, but I just wasn't wowed by the journey.|  A carefully sculpted and beautifully simple take on the mother-daughter relationship; territory that is relatively unexplored in Hollywood's historically male-driven culture.|  Subtle and not so subtle christian propaganda film from beginning to end.|  Between the critics and other reviews, I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, like many other coming of age films, the plot felt common and replayed.The acting and directing however, were excellent.|  Honestly this movie was just very dull and predictable. And anti-clamatic.|
