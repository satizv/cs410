  I loved it! The plot was fun, the graphics were beautiful, and the music was great.|  Another Pixar home run.|  This was a cute movie that was enlightening on Mexican culture. It was a bit slow and was not as musical as I assumed it would be, as a movie that is based around music. I really do like this movie and I will watch it again. It is a spectacle.|  A beautiful animation that shows culture and heart. Despite his family's baffling generations-old ban on music, Miguel (voice of newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) dreams of becoming an accomplished musician like his idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice of Benjamin Bratt). Desperate to prove his talent, Miguel finds himself in the stunning and colorful Land of the Dead following a mysterious chain of events. Along the way, he meets charming trickster Hector (voice of Gael Garca Bernal), and together, they set off on an extraordinary journey to unlock the real story behind Miguel's family history.To be completely honest, I had only seen one trailer for this film and I had zero interest. I barely knew what it was about other than Pixar was releasing this film. And to be frank, I just really didn't want to see it. However when I visited my hometown in Washington for Thanksgiving, I decided to utilize my MoviePass and take a trip to the theaters. To no surprise, I really enjoyed the film. It surpassed my expectations and it's definitely a film that I'll remember. To start off, this film is absolutely stunning. Pixar shows us why they're one of the best, if not the best animation studios in existence. The artists and the animators behind this film did a fantastic job. Everything looked extremely detailed and it looked crazy. Every fine grain and every color was given careful attention to and it definitely showed. This honestly looks better than any other animation I've seen this year and it's easily one of Pixar's most beautiful films. The overall story is very strong and emotional. The base of this film is really simple, if not a little bit cliche. But the writers here really knew what kind of film they wanted it to be and that's what made it special. Every beat in this film was so well written and it blew any "generic" possibility out of the water. It's an adventure for a young boy who loves music and it certainly doesn't disappoint. The story is exciting, eventful, and it kept me hooked throughout. I think this is just a really beautiful animation in general. It has a lot of strong motifs and themes that can be applied to many parts of our daily lives. It's something that can appeal to both mass audiences and small niches because it's not just a kids film. It's a kids film that can be entertaining for older audiences. There are just so many aspects that mesh well together and it makes this a very nice and heart warming film.In the end, "Coco" was a fantastic film and one of the highlights of the year.|  The afterlife has been at the center of many films in the past. Man's fascination with death and what may come afterward has always been a wealthy fodder for faith and art, and cinema is no exception. Since 1911's L'INFERNO ( Giuseppe De Liguoro, Adolfo Padovan, Francesco Bertolini) portrayed a chilling vision of Dante's hell, the after-world has been a constant presence in movies, being visited on occasion by Hercules, Santo, or even Robin Williams. Its portrayal has been at times grim, terrifying, institutional or spectacular.Pixar's COCO falls into that latest category. It's probably the most gorgeous depiction of the Great Beyond, with its vibrant bridge of flowing petals linking the world of the living to a stunningly colourful Netherworld. The contrast could have been expressed in the same way the land of the dead was distinguished from the real world by having the latter look desaturated, like in Burton's THE CORPSE BRIDE. But directors Lee Unkrich (TOY STORY 2 and 3) and Adrian Molina tried a different approach.The Mexican town in which lives young Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) remains sunny and vibrant, exhibiting all the bright festive hues associated with the Dia de Muertos celebrations, and yet the afterlife still manages to turn the colour knob all the way to 11.COCO follows the adventures of young Miguel, who wants nothing more than become a musician like the celebrated Ernesto De La Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), thus defying the family's shoe-making tradition. As he attempts to ''borrow'' the deceased Ernesto's guitar from his crypt, he is sent to the Land of the Dead, and can only return home if a dead relative offers him his blessings. Not an easy task, as his dead family, like the living one, opposes his dreams of being a musician. They resent Miguel's great-grandfather who left his family to pursue his own musical ambitions, never to return.Deeply rooted in a Mexican culture, COCO nonetheless suffers from Disney boiling down the essence of that very culture to often trite stereotypes; The dead sports the decorated sugar skulls associated with Da de Muertos. You get mariachis, Frida Kahlo and masked wrestlers (with a cameo appearance by the Legendary Santo in the After Life). However, it's difficult in an animated movie to stay away from cultural clichs, as was the case with the Guillermo Del Toro produced THE BOOK OF LIFE, which shares a certain amount of plot points with COCO. They also fish out other worthwhile aspects of Hispanic folklore in inspired moments, like for instance a traditional song about la Llorona (A spine-chilling fable about a crying woman's ghost, forever mourning her slain children). Furthermore, there has been attempts of late by Disney/Pixar to redeem themselves by avoiding the typical whitewashing. MOANA had Hawaiian actors and The Rock (who has Samoan descent) playing Polynesians, all citizens of the wider Pacific Islands. In COCO, the cast is mostly populated by Hispanics. While some of them are well known performers, none are of the calibre of the stars that often do voices in such animated fare. Although it can be argued that Disney doesn't really need stars to sell at this point, and that type of casting can further help to absolve the lack of cultural subtlety. COCO further tried to ''pander'' by having its premiere in Mexico, a whole week ahead of the rest of the world.What matters in the end is the movie's impact, and in this case, COCO packs a heck of an sentimental wallop. Like most Pixar movies, it grounds its story in a very human principle which in this case is our relationship with the afterlife, and this need to be remembered. It's the basic emotional core of COCO, and it reaches a particular crescendo when the titular character, who is a secondary player in appearance, but drives the whole story, is starting to forget about one of her dead relative, threatening to cause his ''second death'' in the the Land of the Dead. It brings home some powerful concepts that may escape the kiddies, but that most adults will be able to relate to. It's particularly poignant to name a movie that deals mostly with the importance of living in one's memories, after a character who is obviously battling Alzheimer's disease. The scene where Miguel attempts to jog her remembrance with a song (a technique that has proven effective in real life) that had until then being used in a rather smarmy way in the film, will make the most hardhearted cry their eyes out.In short, Pixar has done it again, creating a touching, gorgeous and ultimately relevant movie that will bring a certain amount of food for thoughts to the young and older ones, dazzle with its vibrant palette, and stand the test of time with its strong emotional core, providing an answer to the query posed by its Oscar bait of a theme song: ''Remember me.''We certainly will.|  Visually stunning as much as it is heart warming. Coco tackles difficult topics like death and the afterlife with just the right amount of humor.|  The Book of Life was one of my favorite films of 2014. When I first saw the trailer for Coco, it was hard not for me to draw comparisons. A celebration of the Day of the Dead. Mariachi. Centered around music. Coco brings its own flavor, however, a unique experience all its own. In fact, if it weren't for the god-awful twenty-five-minute Frozen short right before (since removed due to numerous complaints), this would have been close to a perfect moviegoing experience.Little Miguel loves music. He has to sneak away to watch old recordings of his favorite musician Ernesto de la Cruz because the rest of his family thinks music is a curse. Following a mysterious chain of events (don't want to ruin it for you), Miguel finds himself in the Land of the Dead and must somehow find a way to get home before its too late.The colors. Oh man, the colors. Vibrant, popping off the screen. It screams life even during the scenes in the Land of the Dead. This is one film I wish I would have seen in IMAX. The colors add an amazing pop, from the spirit animals to the city landscapes at night, making this one of the most beautiful animated films I have seen.The colors alone are just a small touch to the overall creativity and originality behind Coco. The Land of the Dead is loaded with sights to behold, some you might miss if you blink. The attention to detail is spectacular from the cool bridge that guides the dead to the Land of the Living to the colorful spirit animals. I've seen a lot of movies and I haven't seen anything like this. Not only are the visuals amazing, but the music holds its own as well, driving the entire story in an entertaining and powerful way. There are a lot of touching moments that revolve around the soundtrack. There will be musical numbers that make you laugh while others leave you with more of a somber feel. Maybe I cried a little. Maybe I didn't. You'll never know for sure. One thing I can say is this movie was about as touching as any I have seen this year.Disney/Pixar is known for leaving you with a great message and Coco is no exception. Miguel was willing to follow his dreams at all costs, even if it cost him his life. How many of us can say the same? Another phenomenal job by Pixar. I give the film a 96.|  I loved this movie so much I want to see it again|  Best Pixar movie in years|  'Coco' is a surprisingly touching and enjoyable adventure. It always tackles sensitive topics such as death and familial feud with engaging performances and fun, heartwarming moments. One can tell that care went into making sure that there is as little dead space in between events and that slower scenes are still beautiful and entertaining. The music is noteworthy too, as it should be for a film of this kind, and serves as a vehicle that connects the audience to Mexico and its culture. 'Coco' is somewhat of a triumph in an age where I though all the big animation houses were past their ability to create a above-average features.|  Beautiful animation and a fun time for family members and Disney fans, Pixar still has the magic of making great animated stories. A-|  Pixar did it again, so touching|  Very well done animated film. I enjoyed the visual style quite a bit, and enjoyed the exploration of Mexican culture.|  Absolutely spectacular movie !! I must own this and watch ALL the special features and ?making of? features - cried sooo much and could hear ppl crying in the theatre - bring your tissues - the importance of familia is so pronounced in this movie and the real explanation of what the day of the dead represents for Mejicanos is awesome|  Best animated film this year for sure|  Absolutely loved it. Besides being adorable, it had a great message. I found myself at least 6 times saying, "Unbelievable" when referring to the animation. So lifelike, so real. Really well done. [4.5 stars]|  Visually a pleasure (just beautiful) and a great plot where a young boy learns about his ancestors in the land of the dead.|  A wonderful Movie, showing the beauty in music, and how it can bring humanity, family, and people apart or together once again. It takes place in Mexico, and shows that we must always remember our loved ones, through memory, songs, pictures and gifts, so that they can still meet us even when we are at the other side.|  Possibly my favourite Pixar/Disney movie of all time|  Pixar did it again, by striking gold with this much needed film, specially in this times of diplomatic tension between the United States and Mexico. (On a small note, the Adidas as seen within a Mexico footbal soccer shirt, joins Babie and Mr. Potato Head, as one of the real brands seen within a Pixar film.)|
