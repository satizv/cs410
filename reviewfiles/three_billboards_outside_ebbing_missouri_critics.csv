 Three Billboards lands somewhere near Coen brothers country, eloquently finding comedy in horror and vice versa.| An instant classic.| "Cathartic or livable" might as well be the Midwestern ethos; it's the land of displacement, or being between two poles, and Three Billboards is a rare movie to so perfectly capture how there's still beauty (and hope) in it.| A good chunk of Three Billboards is about redemption and how people are stubbornly complex, able to be many things at once. A man can be good and noble and still be prideful in ways that deprive children of a father.| Possibly Francis McDormand's best performance leads the way for a spectacular cast and crew to tell a stirring story of grief and redemption.| Three Billboards assumes the aspect of world-weary malcontent but is really just a patronizing scold.| Three Billboards holds you as so few movies do these days. And it does so with the basics: character, dialogue and emotion.| [Frances] McDormand commands the material, instead, by playing Mildred small and close; her volatility-and her pain-are right there in her acute gaze and pursed mouth, but she rarely even has to raise her voice. | Compelling, and richly drawn drama about characters smashing in to one another in a world that doesn't make sense...| It's worth noting that McDormand's performance in the role is one of the best this year; she's raw, grounded, and wickedly funny.| Martin McDonagh's latest and best film to date journeys through familiar territory with no shortcuts or quick exits. [Full review in Spanish]| [Frances] McDormand's performance is breathtaking as she dances between an acidic toughness and a numbing vulnerability that makes Mildred Hayes one of the most fully realized characters of the decade.| A tonal disaster.| Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is Martin McDonagh's most scorching work to date; it's immensely entertaining, engaging, savagely brutal, stingingly written with social relevancy, and layered gracefully with musings on anger| But while that is a rage that's exhilarating to witness, it's a rage that's not available to everyone. Just as not everyone in Ebbing can claim the protection of being considering "good," we still don't live in a world where everyone gets to be angry.| McDonagh is gifted enough to make you feel like you're watching something important and penetrating, rather than just bilious| McDonagh's "In Bruges" is one of the great cinematic works of the new century. "Three Billboards" doesn't come close, even though it traffics in similar crackling dialogue and tremendous performances.| Grim, often hilarious, and consistently thought-provoking... McDormand and Rockwell have never been better.| The movie is one of the angriest films in recent memory. Yet it has moments of unlikely (yet hilarious) comedy and sincere tenderness, along with acts of nearly unwatchable violence| Despite my reservations, Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri is certainly memorably clever and boldly conceived. And any film that allows McDormand to strut her to stuff to this degree can't be all bad.|
