  I wanted to see a movie that would make me laugh. This did it.|  I love a bawdy, cheesy holiday movie but this is just pathetic. By the end of the movie, you're only wondering how much money these women got to debase themselves with such a horrible script.|  Absolutely not funny. You actually come out feeling bad. The kids and the grandmas scripts were unfunny, not realistic. Uncomforablely not fun or funny.|  Love, love, love! I wasn't sure this movie would be able to live up to the comedy in the first movie but it did. I laughed, I cried, and I definitely enjoyed every minute of this movie. Can't wait to watch it again!|  It would be difficult to comment on this movie in terms of quality of movie itself. With this type of movie all that should count is if it's silly, funny, and makes a good escape from reality for both Moms and Grandmas. Too bad it's so in the gutter with sex and language. Why don't writers try to get beyond the shock value of having a what appears to be 7 year old repeat the phrase "oh my f-ing God"? Maybe because they aren't talented enough to write anything else. It's the equivalent of fart jokes by your 7th grade friend, and it's lazy, lazy, lazy. Don't give Hollywood your money or your vote on this one. Stay home and be a good Mom.|  Funny all the way through.|  This movie was great! I have seen both movies and they both made me laugh. I'm happy I seen this!!|  garbage, editor should be fired because this glowing effect on the whole fucking movie|  more of the same as the first film|  A Bad Moms Christmas is made for a specific viewer. While I might not be that viewer, I think that the movie itself has its moments and is enjoyable by that specific audience. The chemistry between Bell, Kunis, and Hahn is felt throughout and the addition of the new mother characters only add to the fun. Overall the movie is worth seeing, just maybe not in the big cinema form.|  Christmas sequel that's nowhere near as funny as the original|  Very much like the 1st film, directed like a sitcom that needs a montage every 20 minutes to fill the running time but quite funny. Very much enjoyed the Bad Moms' moms and hoping for the hinted at spin off.|  There are some real laughs in this movie, but not enough depth to warrant any real recommendation.|  I could copy paste the review from "Daddy's Home 2" take out the part about the cast and add that it is worse than the original and that sums up this movie. Not worth seeing.|  Absolutely outrageous!!!!|  Wasn't the best. Kristen Bell and her Mum have the funniest bits. The rest of it is pretty cringeable. In particular, wax girl. Absolutely feral, and not in a good way.|  It was funny. I'm glad I went to see it. I'm glad I'm not a part of those families.|  just as good as the first and even better!!!|  A good movie but not too much, made me laugh a lot but was too disturbed I loved the first film.|  The chemistry of Mila and her friends is just so awesome. These movies are a great series, and one that i really don't seem to get tired of watching!|
