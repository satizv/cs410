  Had some really funny parts. Storyline was rather predictable, but had me laughing.|  Actually got a few laughs but sadly just another not so funny christmas movie.|  Just awful. That's about it. Didn't laugh once, the performances are weak, there is no style to the filmmaking and the ideas are extremely uninspired. Another dumb Christmas comedy. The only positive thing is that Mel Gibson is enjoyable enough to watch, I guess...|  What a sad missed opportunity. Great cast, boring, lazy writing. I was hoping for something almost as great as Christmas Vacation, but ended up being a flat, non-funny turd. What a shame!!!|  This is a terrible movie, but I am not suprised, that so many viewers liked it. After all, Trump was elected. Don't spend your money on this.|  I enjoyed this movie. Light-hearted and funny.|  Absolutely laugh out loud funny!! No better X-mas movie!|  Funny and slapstick and worth watching for me.|  Very funny. If you liked the original, you've love this one.|  It wasn't really funny until I fell asleep.|  with the same wit and excitement as the first film, daddy's home 2 succeeds in the comedy department and a great christmas film. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg have great chemistry and the supporting cast bounces fun jokes off each other. Although the second act of the film is a little slow, the film picks up and is great fun.|  As expected, an incredibly predicable & cheesy movie. The visual equivalent of a large platter of cheap, tavern prepared, gut wrenching nachos. A waste of time & $$.|  I didn't see Daddy's Home I, but I might just go watch this one. It's got an interesting combination of actors that I just can't resist.|  Loved this movie!!! The review score does this movie no justice!|  This is not a very good movie it looks good at the beginning but then it get dumb|  Will Ferrell once again brings his typical comedy gold to the big screen. The fathers were cast perfectly and are the saving grace of this movie. There are some messages throughout the movie that are unsuitable for children like theft and felonies treated casually, as well as some inappropriate interactions between characters. This is a fun movie most enjoyed by the 15 and up crowd.|  I thought Mel Gibson was gonna kick ass in this film, But he turns out to just be a jerk! The cast is Extremely talented and have been in great movies, But they can't save this piece of crap!|  I don't understand the hate. To be honest I was ready to hate it but it won me over and it was funny everyone in the theater seemed to truly enjoy it. I am glad my friends dragged me along and I would recommend giving it a chance.|  Follows exactly the same formula as the first Daddy's Home. A few laughs and will be around for years due to its Christmassy nature, but doesn't live long in the memory.|  Decent movie!. John Lithgow is actually pretty funny. Much better than the first one, however not a movie I would watch over and over!.|
