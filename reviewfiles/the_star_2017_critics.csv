 The film fails to overcome its religious origin and go beyond being a simple and uni-directional propaganda. [Full Review in Spanish]| Yes, while it aims to combine celebrity voices, memorable music and Christian values, The Prince of Egypt this ain't.| Poop jokes are among the least of the weirdly tone-deaf extravagances peppering The Star.| Could this be the moment animated anthropomorphism finally jumped the shark?| The film believes its myths and propagates them through some of the cheesiest God pop you could ever dread to hear.| This thin storyline is padded out with subplots that showcase a bizarrely star-studded voice cast.| Cynics may roll their eyes at the clash of religious scripture and celebrity voicing (Kelly Clarkson, Oprah Winfrey and Mariah Carey feature) but even they can't deny the efficiency of its expressive animation and creature-feature fun.| It's harmless enough, but nowhere near as inspiring as it aims to be.| Why has nobody thought of this before - the Nativity retold for kids via knockabout animal animation and gloopy pop ballads? Oh yes, because it's an absolutely dreadful idea.| It will be best enjoyed by toddlers who have yet to see a Shrek movie, or prise open a Holy Bible.| A sweet and often (tastefully) funny story of The Nativity told from the perspective of the animals involved. | It's reasonably lively, and not impious (if you ask me), but set against the best cartoons, it's not the greatest story ever told.| Some future shelf life in seminaries seems likely, but as festive treats for kids go, it's like asking for a selection box and being force fed communion wafers instead.| Delivers ... a preachy, bland and fastidiously inoffensive kind of ersatz fun - a little like those knock-off Christian video games from the early 1990s that mimicked existing hits, but which made you pray for people instead of shoot them.| The children I watched it with seemed engaged enough in the animated hijinks, although the overall design aesthetic seemed to me more reminiscent of an unskippable Clash of Clans ad than the characterful top-shelf animated film its cast suggests.| This is a bible-based, animated adventure for children, with the emphasis on cute comedy and familiar pious tropes; it's somewhat dry and bland, but simplicity and an over-qualified voice cast help see it through.| Unless you have tiny, religious children, it's probably best to avoid it.| It is meant as a mild endorsement to point out that this animated nativity story is every bit as good as the jungle adventures of the animated parrots, Blu and Jewel.| While it is harmless enough and sure to pacify viewers under the age of six, The Star serves as the finale of this month's forgettable holiday-themed movie trilogy (following A Bad Moms Christmas and Daddy's Home 2).| Tepid|
