## Introduction
Sentiment analysis in the realm of movie reviews is an important discourse that has been brought up in several papers with some discussion. Natural language processing is the core utility function that is used in these types of analysisâ€™ placing a weight on the sentiment of a movie critic. The sentiment varies widely from very negative to very positive, and an overall score is given to a review to measure whether it exceeded a given threshold, meaning if it was overall a positive or negative review, with an accompanying score. The approach we are taking with critic sentiment, is applying it to how well a movie did in the box office based on how well it was received by critics. The question we are trying to answer is a critically acclaimed movie a hit in the box office?
